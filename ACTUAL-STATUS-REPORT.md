## ❌ What's NOT Working / Needs Fixing

### 1. Notes System ⚠️
**Error**: "Failed to load notes"

**Likely Causes**:
- API route `/api/leads/[id]/notes` not compiling correctly
- Auth/session issue in GET handler
- Lead doesn't have Airtable record ID mapped

**Fix Needed**: Debug the notes GET endpoint

### 2. Analytics Page 🔄
**Status**: Created but NOT compiled yet

**Issue**: Next.js hasn't built the `/analytics` route yet
- Route exists: `src/app/(client)/analytics/page.tsx`
- But not in build manifest
- Needs Hot Module Reload to pick it up

**Fix**: Refresh browser or restart dev server

### 3. Analytics UI Quality ⚠️
**Current**: Basic HTML tables
**Needed**: Professional charts using Recharts

**Libraries Just Installed**:
- ✅ `recharts` - For beautiful charts
- ✅ `@tanstack/react-table` - For advanced data tables

**Need to**: Upgrade analytics UI with proper visualizations

### 4. Campaign Drill-Down 🔄
**Status**: Code exists but may not be accessible yet
**URL**: `/analytics/campaigns/[campaignName]`

**Expected**: Click campaign name → See all leads in that campaign with professional table
