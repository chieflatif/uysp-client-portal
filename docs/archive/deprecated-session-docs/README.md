# DEPRECATED SESSION DOCUMENTATION

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: THESE DOCUMENTS CONTAIN OUTDATED METHODOLOGY**

## Archive Date: 2025-01-27

These session-based documents have been **ARCHIVED** because they contain **conflicting ICP scoring methodologies** that do not align with the current **ICP Scoring V3.0** framework.

### **Why These Were Archived:**

1. **Session 4 ICP Scoring**: Contains **wrong scoring weights**
   - OLD: Company 40%, Person 35%, Engagement 15%, Timing 10%
   - CURRENT V3.0: Company 25%, Person 40%, Engagement 35%

2. **Session 2/3 PDL**: Contains **outdated architecture** replaced by Phase 2A implementation

3. **Session 5 SMS**: Contains **pre-V3.0 routing logic** not aligned with current methodology

### **Current Authoritative Documents:**

✅ **ICP Methodology**: `docs/ICP-SCORING-V3-METHODOLOGY.md`  
✅ **Technical Requirements**: `docs/PHASE-2B-TECHNICAL-REQUIREMENTS.md`  
✅ **Developer Context**: `context/DEVELOPER/PHASE-2B-CONTEXT-PACKAGE.md`  

### **Organization Decision:**

The project now uses **ROLE-BASED** organization (`context/DEVELOPER/`, `context/PM/`, `context/TESTING/`) rather than session-based documentation to align with the three-agent system.

**🚨 DO NOT USE THESE DOCUMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  
**Reference only current V3.0 methodology and Phase 2B specifications**
