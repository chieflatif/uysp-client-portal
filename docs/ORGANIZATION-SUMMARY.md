YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md
```

**Examples**:
- `2025-10-19-week1-completion.md` - Week 1 completion report
- `2025-10-19-validation.md` - Quality validation on Oct 19

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Auto-sorts chronologically
- ✅ Easy to find latest documents
- ✅ Clear date context
- ✅ Professional structure

ls -lt docs/session-reports/ | head -1

# Check quality metrics
cat docs/quality/*.md

# Find handoff context
cat docs/handoffs/week-2.md
```

### For Next Session
1. Read `/docs/handoffs/week-2.md` first (context)
2. Check `/docs/progress/PROGRESS.md` (milestones)
3. Review `/docs/session-reports/` (history)
4. Check `/docs/quality/` (metrics)

### For Documentation
1. Keep quick reference in root
2. Move all reports to `/docs/`
3. Use date-based naming
4. Update PROGRESS.md regularly
