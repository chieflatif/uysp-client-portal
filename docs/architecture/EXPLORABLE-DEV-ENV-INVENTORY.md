# Explorable Development Environment: Component Inventory

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Initial Draft

## 1. Overview

This document provides a complete inventory of the files, scripts, and documentation that constitute the "Explorable Development Environment." The system is designed to be exported and bootstrapped into new projects, providing a robust, rules-based framework for AI-assisted development.

The inventory is categorized into three main pillars:
1.  **Export & Setup System**: The scripts that package and deploy the environment.
2.  **Context Engineering & Rules**: The core logic and constraints governing the AI.
3.  **Backup & Versioning**: The systems that ensure project stability and history.

## 2. Export & Setup System

This system is responsible for packaging the development framework and deploying it to a new project.

| Path                                                      | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `framework-export-system/scripts/framework-export.sh`     | Script   | **(Primary)** Master script that bundles the entire framework (`.cursorrules`, `context`, `docs`, `scripts`, `patterns`, `templates`) into an `framework-export` directory. |
| `framework-export-system/scripts/framework-import.sh`     | Script   | *(Generated by export)* Automates the setup of the framework in a new project, customizing templates and variables.                                                     |
| `framework-export-system/scripts/framework-validate.sh`   | Script   | *(Generated by export)* Verifies that the framework was imported correctly by checking for critical files, directories, and script permissions.                        |
| `framework-export-system/docs/FRAMEWORK-EXPORT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md` | Doc      | The main guide explaining how to use the export/import system.                                                                                                            |
| `setup-context-engineering.sh` (v1, v2, v3)               | Script   | (Legacy) Earlier versions of setup scripts. Focused on in-place setup rather than export. Valuable for historical context.                                               |
| `uysp-context-generator.sh`                               | Script   | Generates session-specific `README.md` files within `context/session-*` to provide focused, contextual instructions for the AI for each development phase.              |

## 3. Context Engineering & Cursor Rules

This is the intelligent core of the environment, defining the rules, constraints, and context the AI operates within.

| `.cursorrules/00-CRITICAL-ALWAYS.md`             | Rule     | The "golden rules" that are always active. Enforces forensic analysis before action, anti-hallucination protocols, and MCP tool verification.                     |
| `.cursorrules/01-evidence-templates.md`          | Rule     | Provides standardized templates for presenting evidence of completed work.                                                                                   |
