# SOP: Account Executive Lead Follow-up Interface

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Purpose**: This guide explains how to use the "High-Score Lead Follow-up" Interface in Airtable. This tool is designed to give you a clean, focused list of the highest-value leads that are ready for manual outreach.
- **Goal**: Your goal is to work through the list of assigned leads, attempt to make contact, add notes about your interactions, and update the lead's status to reflect the outcome (e.g., "Booked," "Archived").
- **Access**: You will receive a direct link to this interface. It is a simplified web page and does not require you to navigate the full Airtable database.

## 2. How it Works: The Lead Queue
The list of leads you see in the interface is automatically generated based on a few simple rules:
- **High Score Only**: It only includes leads with an `{ICP Score}` of 75 or higher.
- **Active Leads Only**: It automatically filters out any leads that have already been marked as "Archived" or "Stopped."

This means the list is a pre-qualified, real-time queue of the best leads for you to contact.

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access the Interface
1.  Open the unique link provided to you by the operations team.
2.  The page will load with a list of leads on the left-hand side. The first lead in the list will be selected and its details shown on the right.

### Step 2: Review the Lead's Information
- On the right side of the screen, you will see all the information we have on the selected lead:
    - `Full Name`, `Company Name`, `Job Title`
    - `Company Description`
    - `Personal LinkedIn`, `Company LinkedIn`
    - `Phone`, `Email`
    - `ICP Score`

### Step 3: Take Action & Add Notes
1.  After you have reviewed the lead and taken an action (e.g., called them, sent an email), you must log your notes.
2.  Find the **`Notes`** field. It will be an editable text box.
3.  Click into the box and add your notes. Be concise but clear. For example:
    - "Left voicemail 2025-09-25. Follow-up email sent."
    - "Spoke with lead, they are interested and want a demo next week."
    - "Contact has left the company."

### Step 4: Update the Lead's Status
1.  This is the most important step. You must update the lead's status to move them out of your queue.
2.  Find the **`Processing Status`** field. This is an editable dropdown menu.
3.  Click on it and select the appropriate new status based on the outcome of your action:
    - **`Booked`**: Select this if you have successfully booked a meeting with the lead.
    - **`Archived`**: Select this if the lead is not a good fit, the contact information is bad, or they are not interested.
    - **`Contacted - Follow-up`**: You can use a status like this if one exists, for leads you are actively working but haven't booked yet.

**IMPORTANT**: Once you change the status from its initial state to something like "Booked" or "Archived," the lead will be automatically removed from your list (based on the filter rules) so you can move on to the next one.

## 4. Best Practices
- **Update in Real-Time**: Update the notes and status immediately after you take an action. This keeps the data clean and ensures no two people accidentally contact the same lead.
- **Don't Touch Other Interfaces**: Please only use the "High-Score Lead Follow-up" interface you were sent. The other interfaces contain system-level reports and dashboards.
- **Communicate**: If you have questions about a lead or notice data that seems incorrect, please notify the operations team in the appropriate Slack channel.
