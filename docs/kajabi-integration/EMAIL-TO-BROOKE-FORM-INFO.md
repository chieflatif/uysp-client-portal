# Email to Brooke - Kajabi Form Information Request

**To**: Brooke  
**Subject**: Quick info needed for Kajabi integration  

---

Hi Brooke,

I'm finishing up Ian's Kajabi integration and need two things:

**1. What Kajabi plan are you on - Growth or Pro?**  
(Pro plan gives us better API access, but we can work with either)

**2. List of your active forms**  
Go to Website → Forms in Kajabi and send me a screenshot, or just list out the form names and what each is used for (like "JB Webinar Registration", "Sales Webinar", etc.)

This lets us route each form to the right SMS campaign.

If you can get this to me in the next day or two, that'd be great!

Thanks,  
Latif
