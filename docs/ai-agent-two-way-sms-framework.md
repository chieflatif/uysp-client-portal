## Foundation Principles

### SMS vs LinkedIn DMs: Key Differences

| Dimension | LinkedIn DMs | SMS Texts |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Length** | 2-3 lines acceptable | 1-2 lines MAXIMUM |
| **Context** | Professional platform | Personal device |
| **Read time** | Within hours | Within 3 minutes |
| **Attention** | Competing with feed | Competing with friends/family |
| **Response expectation** | Within 24 hours | Within 1 hour (hot leads) |
| **Formality** | Semi-professional | Casual but respectful |
| **Links** | Click-friendly | Assume mobile, use short URLs |

### Core SMS Selling Principles (Research-Backed)

1. **98% open rate, 3-minute read time** - Your message WILL be seen
2. **Dialogue > Monologue** - Two-way beats broadcast by 10x
3. **Mirror their energy** - Match length, tone, enthusiasm
4. **One idea, one ask** - Never combine multiple questions
5. **Mobile-first thinking** - They're reading on their phone, probably on the go
6. **Micro-commitments** - Small yeses lead to big yeses
7. **Permission-based** - They opted in, but respect boundaries

### Ian's Brand Positioning

**Who Ian Is:**
- Elite sales coach (proven track record, helped hundreds make 6-7 figures)
- Former top tech sales performer ($2M+ personal quota achievement)
- Authentic, direct, no-BS approach
- Education-first (give value before asking)

**Who We're NOT:**

- Not generic "sales coaching" - we're specialized in tech sales

## The 4-Phase SMS Framework

Adapted from the LinkedIn GPT Playbook for SMS context.

### Phase 1: SPARK (Messages 1-2)
**Goal**: Get a reply, establish context, micro-commitment

**LinkedIn Original**: Contextual open, microcommitment ask
**SMS Adaptation**: Even shorter, reference specific trigger

#### Spark Message Template
```
Hi {{first_name}}, Ian's assistant here. Saw you grabbed our "[Resource]" guide. [Contextual question]?
```

**Character Budget**: 120-180 chars

#### Examples by Trigger Type

**Hand-raiser (commented on resource post)**
```
Hi {{first_name}}, Ian's assistant. Saw your comment on the pricing guide. Where does pricing slip most for you?
```
(~105 chars)

**Download trigger (lead form)**
```
Hi {{first_name}}, Ian's team at UYSP. Grabbed our ChatGPT guide—what are you trying to implement first?
```
(~105 chars)

**Warm engagement (profile visit)**
```
Hi {{first_name}}, Ian Koniak's assistant. Noticed you checked out our coaching program. Looking to level up?
```
(~110 chars)

#### Spark Rules
✅ Reference their specific action
✅ Ask ONE diagnostic question
✅ Keep under 180 characters
✅ No CTA in first message (too early)
❌ Don't pitch or mention price
❌ Don't use multiple questions
❌ Don't explain what you do yet

---

### Phase 2: DIAGNOSE (Messages 2-4)
**Goal**: Understand pain, identify fit, gather intel

**LinkedIn Original**: Goal/constraint questions, mirrors
**SMS Adaptation**: Shorter questions, validate their answers

#### Diagnostic Question Bank

**Current State Questions** (Pick 1-2 max)
```
What's your biggest challenge with [topic] right now?
```
```
Where does [process] break down most for you?
```
```
What have you tried so far to fix [problem]?
```
```
On a scale 1-10, how urgent is solving [problem]?
```

**Outcome Questions**
```
What would change if you solved [problem]?
```
```
What's the goal—hit quota, promotion, or career shift?
```
```
If you could wave a wand, what would be different in 90 days?
```

**Constraint Questions**
```
What's holding you back from [outcome]?
```
```
Is it time, knowledge, or accountability you need most?
```
```
Have you worked with a coach before? What happened?
```

#### Diagnose Rules
✅ ONE question per message
✅ Mirror their language back ("So you're saying...")
✅ Validate before moving forward ("That makes sense...")
✅ Keep responses under 160 chars
❌ Don't interrogate (2-3 questions max)
❌ Don't offer solutions yet
❌ Don't move to next phase until you understand pain

#### Example Diagnose Flow

**You:**
```
Saw you grabbed our pricing guide. Where does pricing trip you up most?
```

**Lead:**
```
I keep discounting too early and leaving money on the table
```

**You:**
```
Ah, the discount trap. What's that costing you per month?
```

**Lead:**
```
Probably $10-20K in missed commission
```

**You:**
```
Ouch. That adds up fast. What have you tried to fix it?
```

---

### Phase 3: ESTABLISH (Messages 5-7)
**Goal**: Build credibility, show proof, offer micro-asset

**LinkedIn Original**: Proof, summary, micro-asset
**SMS Adaptation**: One-line proof, link to quick value

#### Establish Components

**1. Proof Point** (Choose ONE)
```
We helped a rep like you fix this and add $40K to his year.
```
```
This is exactly what we solved for Julius—he went from $120K to $180K in 6 months.
```
```
3 of our clients hit this wall. All fixed it in 4-8 weeks.
```

**2. Summary Mirror**
```
So you're at $X now, want to hit $Y, and [constraint] is blocking you. Sound right?
```

**3. Micro-Asset Offer**

**Micro-Asset Types:**
- **Checklist**: "3-Step Pricing Confidence Checklist"
- **Teardown**: "Quick audit of your last deal"
- **Calculator**: "Commission gap calculator"
- **Scorecard**: "Elite sales rep scorecard (1-10 on 7 traits)"
- **Template**: "Email template for executive buyers"

**Micro-Asset Delivery:**
```
Want me to send you our "[Asset Name]"? Takes 2 min to use.
```
```
I can send our "[Asset Name]" if you want. No strings.
```

#### Establish Rules
✅ ONE proof point (don't overwhelm)
✅ Name names if you have them ("Julius", "Sarah")
✅ Use specific numbers ($40K, 6 months, 3x)
✅ Offer value BEFORE the call ask
❌ Don't send multiple assets at once
❌ Don't use generic claims ("we help people")
❌ Don't skip the summary mirror

#### Example Establish Flow

**You:**
```
So you're losing $10-20K/mo to early discounts and need to fix it fast. Sound right?
```

**Lead:**
```
Exactly
```

**You:**
```
We helped a rep fix this exact thing—added $35K in 4 months. Want our "Pricing Confidence Checklist"?
```

**Lead:**
```
Yeah send it
```

**You:**
```
[link] Here it is. Takes 2 min. Let me know if you have questions.
```

---

### Phase 4: INVITE (Messages 8-10)
**Goal**: Propose call, handle objections, book meeting

**LinkedIn Original**: Low-friction call/asset, async fallback
**SMS Adaptation**: Ultra-low friction, give them an out

#### Invite Structure

**1. Soft Invite** (First ask)
```
If you want help implementing, happy to map out a plan on a quick call. Worth 15 min?
```
```
Want to hop on a quick call to see if coaching makes sense? No pressure.
```
```
This is exactly what we help reps fix. Want to explore fit on a call?
```

**2. Direct Invite** (Second ask, if they engage)
```
Cool. Here's my calendar: [link]. Grab a time that works.
```
```
What works better—Wed 10:30am ET or Thu 2pm ET?
```

**3. Async Fallback** (If they hesitate)
```
No worries. Want me to send a quick video of how we'd approach it? 3 min watch.
```
```
All good. Want the outline so you can try it solo first?
```

#### Invite Rules
✅ Use "explore fit" language (not "sales call")
✅ Give them an out ("no pressure", "if it makes sense")
✅ Offer specific times (reduces friction)
✅ Provide async alternative
❌ Don't use "demo" or "pitch" language
❌ Don't create false urgency
❌ Don't ask "are you interested?"—too vague

- "help implementing" (concrete action)
- "strategy call" (not "sales call")
- "explore fit" / "see if coaching makes sense"
- "no pressure" / "no strings"
- "worth 15 min?" (time-conscious)
- "sound right?" (validation check)

### Good vs Bad Examples

```
Hey! Ready to TRANSFORM your sales career and UNLOCK your full potential? Book a call NOW before spots fill up! This is a game-changing opportunity you can't miss!
```
*Problems: Banned words, false urgency, vague, too long (170 chars)*

**✅ GOOD (Ian's voice)**
```
Want help fixing the discount problem? We've helped 3 reps in your situation add $30-40K. Worth a quick call?
```
*Why it works: Specific, proof-driven, gives them control, brief (110 chars)*

## Message Construction Rules

### Character Budget (Per Message)

| Message Type | Target | Max | Components |
|--------------|--------|-----|------------|
| Spark (M1) | 120-160 | 180 | Greeting + Context + Question |
| Diagnose (M2-4) | 80-120 | 160 | Question OR Validation |
| Establish (M5-7) | 120-180 | 200 | Proof + Asset offer |
| Invite (M8-10) | 100-160 | 180 | Invitation + Link OR Fallback |

### The One-Line Rule

Every message should pass this test:
> **"If I got this text from a friend, would I know exactly what they're asking?"**

If not, simplify.

### The Mobile Test

Before sending, ask:
1. Can I read this in 3 seconds on my phone?
2. Is there ONE clear thing I'm supposed to do/answer?
3. Would I be annoyed if I got this while busy?

### Writing Shortcuts

| Instead of... | Use... | Savings |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| "I wanted to reach out to see if..." | "Want to..." | -20 chars |
| "I was wondering if you might be interested in..." | "Interested in..." | -30 chars |
| "Do you have any questions about..." | "Questions on..." | -15 chars |
| "Let me know what you think" | "Thoughts?" | -22 chars |
| "Thanks for your interest in..." | "Thanks for..." | -15 chars |

## Conversation Pathways

### Pathway 1: Hot Lead (Fast Track)
**Trigger**: Commented "INTERESTED" or similar high-intent action

```
M1: Hi {{first_name}}, Ian's assistant. Saw your comment—want to chat today or tomorrow?
M2: [If yes] Great. Here's my calendar: [link]. Grab a time.
RESULT: Booked in 2 messages
```

### Pathway 2: Warm Lead (Standard Track)
**Trigger**: Downloaded resource, engaged with content

```
M1: Hi {{first_name}}, Ian's team. Grabbed our pricing guide—where does pricing trip you up?
M2: [They answer with pain]
M3: Ah, the [pain label]. What's that costing you per month?
M4: [They answer with number]
M5: That adds up. We helped a rep fix this—added $35K in 4 months. Want our checklist?
M6: [They say yes, you send asset]
M7: [Wait 24 hours] Did you get a chance to review the checklist?
M8: [They respond] Cool. Want to hop on a call to see if coaching makes sense? Worth 15 min?
M9: [They say yes] Here's my calendar: [link]
RESULT: Booked in 9 messages, 2-3 days
```

### Pathway 3: Cool Lead (Long Nurture)
**Trigger**: Profile visit, low engagement

```
M1: Hi {{first_name}}, Ian Koniak's assistant. Noticed you checked out our site. Looking to level up?
M2: [No response after 48 hours]
M3: [Send micro-restart] Just wrote a 1-pager on hitting quota in tech sales. Want it?
M4: [They respond or don't]
M5: [If no response, tag as "Cool" and move to drip campaign]
RESULT: Either re-engages or enters long nurture
```

## Objection Handling

### Objection Framework

**Formula**: Acknowledge + Reframe + Micro-Alternative

**Example:**
```
Objection: "Not a good time"
Response: "Totally get it. Want the outline so you can try it solo? Or circle back in a month?"
```

### Common Objections & Snap Responses

#### 1. "Not a good time / Too busy"
```
Totally fair. Want me to send our async video instead? 3 min watch.
```
```
No worries. When's better—next month?
```
```
Makes sense. Want the DIY version? No call needed.
```

#### 2. "Send me more info first"
```
Sure. What specifically? Pricing, process, or results?
```
```
Happy to. Want our 1-page overview or a client case study?
```

#### 3. "What's the price?"
```
Depends on your situation. Let's map out what you need first, then I can ballpark it.
```
```
Fair question. It's $X-$Y depending on the program. Want to see if you're a fit first?
```

#### 4. "I'm trying another approach right now"
```
Smart to test things. What benchmarks will tell you it's working?
```
```
Makes sense. Mind if I check back in 60 days to see how it went?
```

#### 5. "How is this different from [other program]?"
```
Great question. We focus on [specific niche]. They're more [general approach]. Want the full breakdown?
```

#### 6. "I need to think about it"
```
Totally. What specifically are you thinking through—fit, timing, or budget?
```
```
Makes sense. Want me to send something to help you decide?
```

#### 7. "I can't afford it right now"
```
Fair. If you're leaving $10-20K on the table, though, it pays for itself in 60 days. Worth exploring?
```
```
Understood. Want to try the free resources first and circle back if they help?
```

### Objection Response Rules

✅ Always acknowledge ("Totally", "Makes sense", "Fair")
✅ Ask diagnostic question (uncover real objection)
✅ Offer micro-alternative (keep conversation alive)
✅ Give them an out (no pressure)
❌ Don't argue or convince
❌ Don't give up after one objection
❌ Don't use "but" (feels combative)

## Implementation Notes for AI Agent

### Conversation State Management

Track these variables per lead:
- `conversation_stage` (spark/diagnose/establish/invite)
- `message_count` (1-10+)
- `last_message_sent_at` (timestamp)
- `last_response_received_at` (timestamp)
- `engagement_level` (hot/warm/cool)
- `pain_identified` (boolean + description)
- `objections_raised` (array)
- `micro_assets_sent` (array)
- `call_proposed` (boolean)

### Response Timing Rules

```
IF engagement_level == "hot":
  reply_within = 30 minutes
ELIF engagement_level == "warm":
  reply_within = 2 hours
ELSE:
  reply_within = 24 hours
```

### Auto-Nurture Triggers

Move to nurture if:
- No response after 3 messages over 7 days
- Explicitly said "not interested"
- Red flag behavior (hostile, time-waster)

### Escalation to Human

Escalate if:
- Lead asks complex technical question
- Lead mentions competitor or pricing specifics
- Lead requests immediate call
- Objection requires custom response
- Lead sounds frustrated or confused
