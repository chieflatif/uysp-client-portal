# AI Training Data: Lead Form Initial Messages

## ⚠️ TL;DR for AI Agent

**CRITICAL**: These are SMS text messages - BREVITY IS PARAMOUNT
- **Target**: 280-320 characters (2 SMS segments)
- **Hard Maximum**: 350 characters (never exceed)
- **Current "good" examples are TOO LONG** (350-420 chars) - AI must condense
- **Rule**: If it wouldn't fit on your phone screen in 2-3 bubbles, it's too long

**Winning Formula** (260-280 chars):
```
Hi {{first_name}}, Ian's assistant here. Saw you grabbed our "[Resource]" guide. Want help implementing? Book a call: [calendly link]
```

## Purpose
This document provides training examples and patterns for AI-generated initial SMS messages sent after a lead downloads a resource or joins a training. These are **first-touch messages** designed to acknowledge the download and offer a next step.

**CONTEXT**: You're texting busy sales professionals on their phones. Every character counts. Get to the point fast.

## Message Structure & Key Elements

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: SMS Character Limits
- **Single SMS**: 160 characters maximum (including spaces)
- **Multi-part SMS**: 153 characters per segment (overhead for concatenation)
- **Practical Target**: 300-400 characters MAXIMUM for 2-3 segments
- **Current Examples**: ~350-420 characters (TOO LONG - need condensing)

### Core Pattern
All effective lead form messages follow this structure:

1. **Greeting + Name**: "Hi {{first_name}}" 
2. **Identity**: "this is Ian's assistant" (shorter) or "Ian's team at UYSP"
3. **Acknowledgment**: "Noticed you grabbed [resource name]"
4. **Micro-Value**: Optional 1-2 word value add
5. **Clear CTA**: "Want help implementing?" or similar
6. **Link**: Calendly booking link (counts as ~70 chars)

### SMS Length Guidelines
- **Ideal**: 280-320 characters (2 SMS segments)
- **Maximum**: 400 characters (3 segments - push limit)
- **Current examples are TOO LONG**: Most are 350-420 chars
- **AI must prioritize brevity**: Every word counts

### Tone Guidelines
- **Conversational**: Write as if from a personal assistant
- **Specific**: Always reference the exact resource downloaded
- **Non-pushy**: Use "if you want" language
- **Action-oriented**: Clear next step without being aggressive

## AI Drafting Guidelines

### DO:
✅ **PRIORITIZE BREVITY** - Target 280-320 characters total
✅ Use {{first_name}} variable for personalization
✅ Reference the exact resource name in quotes
✅ Use action verbs: grabbed, downloaded, watched, joined
✅ Shorten identity: "Ian's assistant" or "Ian's team at UYSP" 
✅ Simplify CTA: "Want help implementing?" or "Interested in coaching?"
✅ Use standard Calendly link: https://calendly.com/d/cm5d-w79-8xp/sales-coaching-strategy-call-rr
✅ Count characters before sending - stay under 320 if possible

### DON'T:
❌ Exceed 400 characters (hard limit for 3 SMS segments)
❌ Use long phrases like "exploring what it could be like to have a sales coach tackle your biggest challenges"
❌ Add filler words or unnecessary context
❌ Use overly sales-y language
❌ Create long, complex sentences
❌ Add pressure or urgency tactics
❌ Forget to acknowledge the specific resource
❌ Write full company name when "UYSP" works

---

- `{{last_name}}` - Lead's last name

- **Examples**: `chatgpt_use_cases`, `pricing_rules`, `executive_email`
- **Format**: lowercase, underscores for spaces

---

## Success Metrics for Message Quality

A high-quality first message should:
1. **Stay under 320 characters** (280-320 is ideal)
2. **Acknowledge specifically** what the lead downloaded (not generic)
3. **Offer clear value** through implementation help or coaching
4. **Include one clear CTA** with booking link
5. **Sound conversational** like a real assistant reaching out
6. **Be mobile-friendly** - short sentences, easy to scan

---

## Examples of POOR Messages (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Too Generic

```
*Problem: Doesn't acknowledge specific resource, no personal touch*

### ❌ Too Pushy
```
Hi {{first_name}}, you NEED to book a call NOW to see results! Limited spots available!
```
*Problem: Aggressive, creates false urgency*

### ❌ Too Long
```

```
**Character Count**: ~500+ characters (4+ SMS segments)
*Problem: Way too long, loses focus, costs multiple SMS segments, recipient loses interest*

### ❌ Even "Good" Examples Are Too Long
```
