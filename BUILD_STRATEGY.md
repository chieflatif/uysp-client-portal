# 🔥 UYSP Portal - Professional Build Strategy

**Effective Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Philosophy**: NO BS, Stripe/Notion Quality, Honest Tracking

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Only mark something DONE when:**
1. ✅ Code is written
2. ✅ Tests pass (or written first)
3. ✅ Builds successfully
4. ✅ Actually tested/working
5. ✅ Date logged in PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

**Everything else is IN PROGRESS or BLOCKED.**

## 💻 COMPONENT STANDARDS

Every component must have:

### ✅ Theme Integration
```tsx
import { theme } from '@/lib/theme';

<div className={`${theme.core.darkBg}`}>
  <h1 className={`${theme.core.white}`}>Title</h1>
</div>
```

### ✅ Error Handling
```tsx
{error && (
  <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-red-900/20 border border-red-700/50">
    {error}
  </div>
)}
```

### ✅ Loading States
```tsx
{isLoading && (
  <div className="animate-spin">
    <Loader2 className="w-4 h-4" />
  </div>
)}
```

### ✅ Accessibility
```tsx
<input aria-label="Email" />
<button disabled={isLoading}>Submit</button>
```

### ✅ Mobile Responsive
```tsx
className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
```

## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM REMINDERS

### Color Hierarchy
- **Red** (#be185d): Most important (1 per page max)
- **Blue** (#4f46e5): Secondary emphasis (2-3 per page)
- **Cyan** (#22d3ee): Active states, highlights
- **White**: Headlines
- **Gray**: Body text

### Component Patterns
- Cards: `theme.components.card`
- Buttons: `theme.components.button.primary|secondary|tertiary|ghost`
- Badges: `theme.components.badge.primary|secondary|tertiary`
- Inputs: `theme.components.input`

## 📈 REALISTIC TIMELINE

**This Week**: 
- Mon-Wed: Auth forms + navbar (6 hours)
- Thu-Fri: Lead detail page (5 hours)

**Next Week**:
- Mon-Wed: Error handling + notes (6 hours)
- Thu-Fri: Dashboard (4 hours)

**Week 3**:
- Mon-Wed: Animations + polish (6 hours)
- Thu-Fri: Testing + docs (4 hours)

**Total**: ~40 hours for professional MVP

## 🚫 RULES

❌ **DON'T**:
- Mark something done without testing
- Skip error handling
- Ignore mobile responsiveness
- Leave console errors
- Commit without validation passing
- Add features not in current tier
- Claim "production ready" for incomplete work

✅ **DO**:
- Test every flow manually
- Handle errors gracefully
- Build mobile-first
- Check console before "done"
- Update tracker immediately
- Focus on current tier only
- Be honest about status

---

## 🎁 When Phase 1 is ACTUALLY Complete

You'll be able to:
```
✅ Register a new account
✅ Login with that account
✅ See navbar with your name
✅ View leads table
✅ Click on a lead
✅ See full lead details
✅ Claim/unclaim leads
✅ Get error messages if things fail
✅ See loading states
✅ Logout
```

**NOT BEFORE THEN.**

---

## 🏆 When We're Actually "Production Ready"

After Phase 1, 2, AND 3:
```
✅ All features working
✅ All tests passing
✅ E2E tests passing
✅ Mobile optimized
✅ Animations smooth
✅ Performance good
✅ Documentation complete
✅ No console errors
✅ Accessibility verified
```

**THEN we can say "production ready."**

Until then: IN DEVELOPMENT.
