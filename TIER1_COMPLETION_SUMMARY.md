## What Was Built

### 1. Authentication System ✅
- **Login Page** (`/login`) - Dark Rebel HQ theme, password visibility toggle, error handling
- **Register Page** (`/register`) - Password strength indicator, validation, bcrypt hashing, duplicate email checking
- **Auth Endpoints** - `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`
- **NextAuth.js Integration** - JWT sessions, credentials provider, middleware protection
- **Database Integration** - PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for user persistence

### 2. Navigation & Layout ✅
- **Navbar Component** - User menu, logout, navigation links, mobile responsive
- **Protected Routes** - Middleware authentication on all client pages
- **Layout Structure** - Clean (client) layout group for authenticated pages

### 3. Dashboard & Pages ✅
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Stats overview (total leads, high ICP, claimed, avg score)
- **Leads List** (`/leads`) - Table with filtering, pagination, ICP color coding
- **Lead Detail** (`/leads/[id]`) - Full lead information, claim/unclaim functionality
- **Settings** (`/settings`) - Settings page placeholder

### 4. API Endpoints ✅
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with validation & hashing
- `GET /api/leads` - Fetch all leads with authentication
- `GET /api/leads/[id]` - Fetch single lead details
- `POST /api/leads/[id]/claim` - Claim lead ownership
- `POST /api/leads/[id]/unclaim` - Release lead ownership

### 5. Design System ✅
- **Rebel HQ Oceanic Theme** - Dark backgrounds, cyan/pink/blue accents
- **Theme Object** - Centralized color management in `/lib/theme.ts`
- **Consistent Styling** - All components use theme colors
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints

## Database Schema

```
users:
  - id (UUID primary key)
  - email (unique)
  - passwordHash (bcrypted)
  - firstName, lastName
  - role (CLIENT)
  - isActive (boolean)

leads:
  - id (UUID)

  - status (from Airtable)
  - claimedBy, claimedAt
  - createdAt
```

## User Flows Verified

### Registration Flow
```
1. Click "Create Account" on login page
2. Enter name, email, password
3. Password strength validates (uppercase, lowercase, number)
4. Submit → creates user in PostgreSQL
5. Success screen → redirects to login
6. Can now login with those credentials
```

### Login Flow
```
1. Enter email & password
2. NextAuth validates against database
3. Password verified with bcrypt
4. JWT session created
5. Redirects to dashboard
6. Navbar shows username
```

### Lead Management Flow
```
1. View /leads page with all leads (11,046 from Airtable)
2. Click on lead → opens /leads/[id]
3. See full lead details
4. Click "Claim Lead" → claim ownership
5. Can view claimed leads, unclaim them
6. Navbar links navigate between pages
```
