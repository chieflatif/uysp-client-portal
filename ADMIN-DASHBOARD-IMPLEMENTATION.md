## 🏗️ User Model Architecture

### There Are Three Types of Users:

**1. SUPER_ADMIN (You)**
- Email: rebel@rebelhq.ai (or your email)
- Client: Can be assigned to Rebel HQ OR left NULL
- Access: Sees ALL clients' data
- Purpose: System administration, manage all clients

**2. ADMIN Users**
- Role: `ADMIN`
- Client: Assigned to a specific client
- Access: Sees ALL data (multi-client view)
- Purpose: Power users, account managers

**3. CLIENT Users**
- Role: `CLIENT`
- Client: Assigned to specific client (e.g., Rebel HQ)
- Access: Sees ONLY their client's data
- Purpose: End users at client companies

---

## 📋 How to Add Users (Your Client's Team)

### From Admin Dashboard:

1. **Login as ADMIN** (rebel@rebelhq.ai)
2. **Go to /admin** (click Admin link in navbar)
3. **Click "Add User"** button (blue button)
4. **Fill in form**:
   - First Name: Sales Manager Name
   - Last Name: Their Last Name
   - Email: manager@clientcompany.com
   - Password: TempPassword123 (they can change later)
   - **Assign to Client**: Select "Rebel HQ" from dropdown
   - **Role**: CLIENT (standard access)
5. **Click "Create User"**
6. ✅ User created and can now login

## 🔒 Security Model

### Client Isolation:
```typescript
// CLIENT users see only their client's data
if (session.user.role === 'CLIENT') {
  leads = leads.filter(l => l.clientId === session.user.clientId);
}

// ADMIN users see all data
if (session.user.role === 'ADMIN' || session.user.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
  // No filter - see everything
}
```

### Airtable Base Assignment:
- Each CLIENT company gets ONE Airtable base
- Multiple users can belong to one client
- Users with same email domain typically belong to same client
- Example:
  - Rebel HQ client → Airtable base `app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS`
  - Users: user1@rebelhq.ai, user2@rebelhq.ai, user3@rebelhq.ai
  - All see same 11,046 leads from that Airtable base

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### For Production:
1. **Change Your Role Strategy**:
   - Option A: Keep yourself as ADMIN with clientId = Rebel HQ (you see all but are "associated" with Rebel HQ)
   - Option B: Change yourself to clientId = NULL (pure system admin, not associated with any client)

2. **Client vs User Distinction**:
   - **Client** = Company (Rebel HQ, Acme Corp, etc.)
   - **User** = Person who logs in
   - Multiple users can belong to one client
   - One Airtable base per client

3. **Airtable Base Usage**:
   - Each CLIENT gets one base
   - That base can have multiple users accessing it
   - Base ID must be unique per client
   - Example: Rebel HQ's base shared by all Rebel HQ users
