# Status & Critical Fixes Needed

**Date**: 2025-10-20  
**Current**: Analytics shows no campaigns

---

## ‚ùå **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

### Campaign Data Missing from Leads Table

**Finding**: All 11,046 leads have `campaign_name = NULL`

**Why**: Airtable Leads table doesn't have a "Campaign Name" field

**Where Campaigns Actually Are**:
1. **SMS_Templates Table** - Defines campaigns ("AI Webinar", "Database Mining")
2. **SMS_Audit Table** - Records which template/campaign was sent to which lead

---

## üîß **Fixes Required**

### Fix 1: Add SMS_Audit Table ‚úÖ DONE
- Added to PostgreSQL schema
- Ready to sync from Airtable

### Fix 2: Sync SMS_Audit Data ‚è≥ NEEDED
- Pull SMS_Audit table from Airtable
- Populate PostgreSQL with audit records
- This gives us the lead ‚Üí campaign mapping

### Fix 3: Update Analytics Queries ‚è≥ NEEDED
**Current**: Queries `leads.campaign_name` (always NULL)
**Needed**: JOIN leads with SMS_Audit to get campaign

```sql
-- Current (WRONG):
SELECT campaign_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM leads 
GROUP BY campaign_name
-- Result: NULL with 11,046 leads

-- Needed (CORRECT):
SELECT 
  -- Extract campaign from SMS_Audit or templates
  CASE 
    WHEN text LIKE '%webinar%' THEN 'AI Webinar'
    WHEN text LIKE '%database%' THEN 'Database Mining'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END as campaign_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT lead_record_id) as lead_count
FROM sms_audit
GROUP BY campaign_name
```

### Fix 4: Get Campaign Names from Templates ‚è≥ NEEDED
- Add SMS_Templates table to schema
- Sync template data
- Use Campaign field from templates

---

## üìä Expected Campaign Data

**From Your Description**:
- "AI Webinar" campaign
- "Database Mining" campaign

**These should show in analytics with**:
- Lead counts
- Sequence step distribution
- Booking rates
- Opt-out rates

---

## üéØ Immediate Actions

1. **Add SMS_Templates table to schema** (5 min)
2. **Sync SMS_Audit from Airtable** (2 min)
3. **Sync SMS_Templates from Airtable** (1 min)
4. **Update analytics to use SMS_Audit** (30 min)
5. **Refresh analytics dashboard** (instant)

---

## üí° Why This Wasn't Obvious

The Leads table doesn't explicitly store campaign names because:
- Campaigns are dynamic (tracked through SMS sequences)
- A lead can be in multiple campaigns over time
- Campaign membership is determined by which messages were sent (SMS_Audit)
- Templates define what campaign is (SMS_Templates.Campaign field)

**I should have checked SMS_Audit table structure earlier.**

**Proceeding with fixes now...**
