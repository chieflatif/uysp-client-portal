# User Role & Permission System - Implementation Summary

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive 3-tier user role and permission system with temporary password workflow and forced password change on first login.

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Role Hierarchy ✅

**Three distinct roles:**

- **SUPER_ADMIN** (Rebel HQ)
  - Full system access
  - Can see all clients
  - Can manage all users
  - No client restrictions

- **CLIENT_ADMIN** (Per Client)
  - Full access to their client only
  - Can add 1 user maximum (1 admin + 1 user per client)
  - Can edit tasks and sync data
  - Cannot see other clients

- **CLIENT_USER** (Per Client)
  - Read-only access to their client
  - Cannot edit tasks or data
  - Cannot manage users
  - Cannot sync data

### 2. Temporary Password Workflow ✅

**Complete flow implemented:**

1. Admin creates user → System generates secure temp password
2. Temp password displayed once in modal (with copy button)
3. User logs in with temp password
4. Middleware forces redirect to /force-change-password
5. User cannot access any other page until password is changed
6. After successful change, redirect to dashboard

**Security features:**
- 12-character passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars
- Excludes ambiguous characters (I, l, O, 0, 1)
- Cryptographically secure random generation
- Password strength indicator on change page
- Comprehensive validation

### 3. User Management UI ✅

**Full-featured admin interface:**

- `/admin/users` page with user list table
- "Add User" button (hidden when limit reached)
- User creation modal with form validation
- Temp password display modal
- User deactivation functionality
- Role badges and status indicators
- Responsive design with theme consistency

**Permission-based visibility:**
- SUPER_ADMIN sees all users across all clients
- CLIENT_ADMIN sees only users in their client
- CLIENT_USER cannot access page (redirected)

### 4. Permission Enforcement ✅

**Comprehensive permission system:**

- Permission helper functions in `/src/lib/auth/permissions.ts`
- Role-based navigation menu (Users link only for admins)
- User count validation (max 2 per client)
- Edit/delete restrictions based on role
- Self-deletion protection

// Updated to use new role system
const hasAdminAccess = session?.user?.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN' ||
                       session?.user?.role === 'CLIENT_ADMIN';
const hasUserManagement = canManageUsers(session?.user?.role || '');

// Updated nav items with permission checks
...(hasUserManagement ? [{ href: '/admin/users', label: 'Users', icon: Shield }] : [])
```

## Database Migration

### Required SQL Migration

Run this SQL to update existing user roles:

```sql
-- Update existing roles to new naming convention
UPDATE users SET role = 'CLIENT_ADMIN' WHERE role = 'ADMIN';
UPDATE users SET role = 'CLIENT_USER' WHERE role = 'CLIENT';
```

**Location:** `/migrations/update-roles.sql`

## Security Considerations

### Password Security ✅
- Temporary passwords are cryptographically secure
- bcrypt with 10 salt rounds for hashing
- Passwords meet complexity requirements
- Temp passwords excluded ambiguous characters

### Session Security ✅
- JWT includes mustChangePassword flag
- Middleware enforces password change before access
- Session updates after password change
- 24-hour session expiration

### Permission Security ✅
- All API endpoints verify authentication
- Role-based permission checks on every request
- Client ID validation prevents cross-client access
- Soft delete prevents data loss

---

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/change-password` - Change user password

### User Management
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create new user
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List users (filtered by role)
- `GET /api/admin/users/[id]` - Get specific user
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/[id]` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/[id]` - Deactivate user

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - For JWT signing
- Database connection variables

### Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Uses existing:
- `next-auth` - Authentication
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `drizzle-orm` - Database ORM
- `zod` - Validation
- `crypto` (Node.js built-in) - Secure random generation

---

## Known Limitations

1. **User Limit**
   - Hard-coded to 2 users per client (1 admin + 1 user)
   - Can be adjusted in `permissions.ts` if needed

2. **SUPER_ADMIN Creation**
   - Must be created directly in database
   - No UI for promoting users to SUPER_ADMIN (by design)

3. **Password Reset**
   - No "forgot password" flow yet
   - Admin can deactivate and recreate user if needed

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Not Implemented (Per Requirements)
These were discussed but not required for MVP:

1. **PM Page Edit Button Control**
   - CLIENT_USER read-only enforcement on PM page
   - Can be added in Phase 2 if needed

2. **Password Reset Flow**
   - "Forgot password" functionality
   - Email-based reset

3. **User Activity Logging**
   - Log user actions to activity_log table
   - Audit trail for security

4. **Bulk User Import**
   - CSV import for multiple users
   - Useful for large client onboarding

5. **Role Change Workflow**
   - UI for changing user roles
   - Currently only SUPER_ADMIN can change roles via API

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
psql -d your_database -f migrations/update-roles.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Code
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# Or deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, etc.)
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Existing users can still log in
- [ ] Role updates applied correctly
- [ ] New user creation works
- [ ] Temp password flow works end-to-end

### 4. Monitor
- [ ] Check logs for authentication errors
- [ ] Verify permission checks working
- [ ] Monitor database for mustChangePassword flag updates

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** User stuck on force-change-password page
**Solution:** Check if `mustChangePassword` flag in database is `true`. If password was changed successfully, it should be `false`.

**Issue:** CLIENT_ADMIN cannot add user
**Solution:** Verify that client has less than 2 active users. Check `isActive` flag in users table.

**Issue:** Temp password not working
**Solution:** Ensure temp password was copied correctly (no extra spaces). Check browser console for API errors.

**Issue:** Navigation menu not showing Users link
**Solution:** Verify user role is `CLIENT_ADMIN` or `SUPER_ADMIN` in session.
