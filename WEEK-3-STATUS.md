## 🎯 What's Connected

**Airtable → PostgreSQL:**
- 📊 Your Leads table → `leads` table
- 📝 Field mapping: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Company, Title, ICP Score, SMS Status
- 🔗 Link: `airtableRecordId` keeps records linked

**Read-Only Protection:**
- ✅ API token is read-only (can't modify Airtable)
- ✅ No write operations attempted
- ✅ Safe to run repeatedly

## 📊 Airtable Schema Detected

Your Airtable has:
- **Leads Table** (with 100+ fields!)
- Companies, Settings, SMS templates, SMS audit logs, backup tables

We're syncing the main "Leads" table with fields:
- Core: Lead, First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone
- Location: Company, Job Title, Company Domain, Location Country
- Scoring: ICP Score, Company Score Component, Role Score Component
- Status: SMS Status, Booked, Processing Status, HRQ Status
- ...and ~100 more fields we can access

## 📅 What's Next

- [ ] Build leads list display page
- [ ] Add lead detail/modal view
- [ ] Claim/unclaim functionality
- [ ] Notes system
- [ ] Manual sync button in admin
- [ ] Schedule sync every 5 minutes
