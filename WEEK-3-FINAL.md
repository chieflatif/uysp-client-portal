## 🎯 How It Works

### Sync Pipeline
```
1. User triggers: POST /api/sync/airtable
2. Service fetches from Airtable (pagination handled)
3. Data mapped to database schema
4. New leads inserted, existing leads updated
5. Response: { status, totalRecords, inserted, updated, duration }
```

### Data Flow
