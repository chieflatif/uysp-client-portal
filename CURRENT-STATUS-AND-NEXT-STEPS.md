# Current Status & What's Actually Working

**Date**: 2025-10-20  
**Portal**: http://localhost:3001

## ✅ What's DONE and WORKING

### 1. Core Architecture ✅
- Hybrid architecture implemented correctly
- Writes go to Airtable (Notes, Remove from Campaign, Status)
- Reads come from PostgreSQL (fast performance)
- 11,046 leads synced from Airtable

### 2. Database Schema ✅
- PostgreSQL tables created:
  - `leads` (with 15 new analytics fields)
  - `sms_audit` (for message tracking)
  - `sms_templates` (for campaign definitions)
  - `users`, `clients`, `notes`, `activity_log`

### 3. Frontend Pages ✅
- Dashboard working
- Leads list working
- Lead detail working (claim, unclaim, remove from campaign)
- Analytics dashboard created (dark theme applied)
- Campaign drill-down page created

### 4. API Endpoints ✅
- `/api/leads/[id]/notes` - Add notes to Airtable
- `/api/leads/[id]/remove-from-campaign` - Stop campaign (writes to Airtable)
- `/api/leads/[id]/status` - Change status
- `/api/analytics/dashboard` - Dashboard stats
- `/api/analytics/campaigns` - Campaign performance
- `/api/analytics/sequences/[name]` - Campaign drill-down
- `/api/analytics/clicks` - Click tracking

## ❌ What's NOT Working Yet

### 1. Campaign Analytics Shows Nothing
**Issue**: All leads have `campaign_name = NULL` in PostgreSQL

**Root Cause**: Campaign names aren't in Leads table - they're in:
- **SMS_Audit table** - Records which campaign/message was sent
- **SMS_Templates table** - Defines campaign names

**Fix Needed**: 
```bash
# Run this command to sync SMS_Audit data:
cd uysp-client-portal
npx tsx scripts/sync-sms-audit.ts
```

### 2. Notes May Show Error
**Status**: Fixed authorization bug, should work after browser refresh

### 3. Leads List Needs Updates
**Requested**:
- Show enrichment status indicator
- Display LinkedIn URL instead of email
- Make LinkedIn URL clickable

## 🔧 Manual Commands to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Sync SMS_Audit Table
```bash
cd "/Users/latifhorst/cursor projects/UYSP Lead Qualification V1/uysp-client-portal"
npx tsx scripts/sync-sms-audit.ts
```

This will:
- Fetch SMS_Audit records from Airtable
- Populate PostgreSQL with message/campaign data
- Enable campaign analytics to work

### Step 2: Refresh Browser
```
Hard refresh: Cmd + Shift + R
```

This will:
- Pick up Analytics nav link
- Load notes fix
- Show dark theme on analytics

### Step 3: Test Analytics
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/analytics
```

Should now show:
- "AI Webinar" campaign stats
- "Database Mining" campaign stats
- Sequence step distribution
- Booking/opt-out rates

## 📊 What the Analytics SHOULD Show (After SMS_Audit Sync)

### Campaign Table:
```
Campaign Name         | Total | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 | Booked | Opt-Out | Clicks
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AI Webinar           |  XXX  |   XX   |   XX   |   XX   |   XX   |   XX    |   XX
Database Mining      |  XXX  |   XX   |   XX   |   XX   |   XX   |   XX    |   XX
```

### Data Sources:
- **Lead counts**: JOIN leads with SMS_Audit on lead_record_id
- **Sequence steps**: From leads.sms_sequence_position
- **Booked/Opt-out**: From leads.booked, leads.sms_stop
- **Clicks**: From leads.click_count, leads.clicked_link
- **Campaign names**: From SMS_Audit (extracted from "SMS Campaign ID" field)

## 🎯 Pending Improvements (Queued)

### Leads List Enhancements:
1. Add enrichment status column (✓ or ✗)
2. Replace email with LinkedIn URL
3. Make LinkedIn clickable
4. Add visual indicators

### Analytics UI Upgrades:
1. Use Recharts for visualizations (installed)
2. Use TanStack Table for advanced sorting/filtering (installed)
3. Add funnel visualizations
