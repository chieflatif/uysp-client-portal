TESTING VALIDATION AGENT - IMMEDIATE INSTRUCTIONS

CONTEXT: Complete testing automation infrastructure has been built and requires full validation.

YOUR MISSION: Clean up Airtable + Execute comprehensive testing + Validate infrastructure meets all requirements

VERIFIED BASELINE:
- Working Workflow: wpg9K9s8wlfofv1u (UYSP WORKING PRE COMPLIANCE - TESTING ACTIVE)
- Smart Field Mapper: Node b8d9c432-2f9f-455e-a0f4-06863abfa10f (v4.6)
- Airtable Base: appuBf0fTe8tp8ZaF, Table: tblSk2Ikg21932uE0
- Webhook: https://rebelhq.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/kajabi-leads

TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE READY:
- Main System: tests/mcp-automated-testing-system.js (17,997 bytes, verified)
- Runner Script: tests/run-automated-tests.sh (989 bytes, executable)
- Enhanced Enforcement: tests/enhanced-anti-hallucination-enforcement.js (validated)

EXECUTE THESE STEPS:

1. AIRTABLE CLEANUP
   - Use mcp_airtable_list_records to find test records (emails ending @testdomain.com, @test.com)
   - Use mcp_airtable_delete_records to remove test data (preserve production records)
   - Verify cleanup with record count before/after

2. FULL TESTING EXECUTION  
   - Run: ./tests/run-automated-tests.sh
   - Monitor: All 5 test categories (Field Mapping, Boolean Conversion, Phone Strategy, Duplicate Handling, Integration Flow)
   - Collect: Execution evidence, success rates, generated results files

3. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
   - Success Rate: ≥80% overall across all categories
   - Evidence Collection: Execution IDs, record IDs, webhook responses documented
   - MCP Integration: N8N + Airtable tools working correctly
   - Results Archive: JSON reports saved in tests/results/
   - Manual Process Replacement: Confirm automation replaces 30-minute manual workflow

4. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT VALIDATION
   - Run: node tests/enhanced-anti-hallucination-enforcement.js
   - Verify: All automation claims backed by MCP tool evidence
   - Validate: No completion claims without user-verifiable results

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Airtable cleaned (test records removed, production preserved)
✅ Testing infrastructure executes successfully
✅ All 5 test categories achieve ≥80% success rate
✅ Evidence properly collected and archived
✅ Enhanced enforcement validation passes
✅ Manual 30-minute process successfully automated

CRITICAL: Use enhanced enforcement validation for all claims. Include confidence scores. Provide specific evidence (execution IDs, record counts, file paths, timestamps).

TOOLS AVAILABLE: MCP N8N suite (39 tools), MCP Airtable suite (13 tools), terminal commands, file system operations.

START WITH: Airtable cleanup, then execute testing infrastructure validation.
