## 📊 Data Flow

### Source of Truth: Airtable
All data originates in Airtable and syncs to PostgreSQL for fast access.

### Task Updates (Inline Editing)
1. User clicks field and makes change
2. **UI updates immediately** (optimistic)
3. PostgreSQL updated first (~10ms)
4. Airtable synced in background (~300ms)
5. If Airtable fails, UI reverts

### Task Creation
1. User clicks "+ New Task"
2. Fills out modal form
3. **Airtable created first** (source of truth)
4. PostgreSQL stores record ID + data
5. Task appears in table

### Call History Sync
- Calls are fetched directly from Airtable (no PostgreSQL storage)
- API calls `/api/clients/[id]/call-history`
- Returns ALL records sorted by date
- Clicking "View Call History" fetches fresh data

## 📞 Call Records in Airtable

### Table: `Project_Call_Summaries`
- **Base ID**: `app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS`
- **Table ID**: `tblvpmq10bFkgDnHa`

### Three Call Records:
1. **October 15, 2025** - `recAhkjKTmWlJBcqw` (historical)
2. **October 22, 2025** - `recLsect851OEsZ5S` (historical)
3. **Most Recent** - `recyswJpePUnKpsDE` (latest, `Is Latest = TRUE`)

### How It Works:
- The `/api/clients/[id]/call-summary` endpoint filters by `Is Latest = TRUE`
- The `/api/clients/[id]/call-history` endpoint fetches ALL records sorted by date
- **Only ONE record** should have `Is Latest = TRUE` at any time
- When a new call is added, update the `Is Latest` field accordingly
