## ⏸️ TIER 2: Advanced Features (Planned - 2 Weeks)

### Feature 1: Campaign Auto-Assignment (4-6 hours) - P0
**Status**: Not started  
**Priority**: Build FIRST (quick win)

**What it does:**
- When lead uploaded with `form_id` → auto-assign to campaign
- Uses mapping table (form → campaign)
- No manual assignment needed

**Implementation:**
- Create `form_campaign_mappings` table
- Admin UI to manage mappings
- Logic: lead.form_id → lookup → set campaign_name

---

### Feature 2: Two-Way Messaging (16-20 hours) - P0
**Status**: Backend ready, UI not built  
**Priority**: Build SECOND (critical for sales)

**What it does:**
- See full SMS conversation history per lead
- AI agent responds to 60-70% of messages automatically
- Complex/negative responses escalate to human review queue
- Sales team sees responses instantly in portal

**Airtable Changes** (manual, 30 min):
```
Add to Leads table:
- conversation_thread (Long Text) - stores JSON array of full conversation
- has_responded (Checkbox) - TRUE if lead replied
- last_inbound_message (Long Text) - latest reply
- last_inbound_at (DateTime) - when they replied
- response_count (Number) - engagement metric
- response_sentiment (Single Select) - positive/neutral/negative
- human_review_flag (Checkbox) - TRUE if needs human

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE (Current & Future)

### Data Architecture - Hybrid Approach ✅

```

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ Separate Airtable base per client (security, compliance, customization)
- ✅ PostgreSQL for fast portal reads
- ✅ Airtable for automation hub (n8n, webhooks)
- ✅ 5-minute background sync keeps them aligned
- ✅ Instant updates via API calls (bypass sync delay for critical data)

### Multi-Tenant Architecture ✅

**Each client gets:**
- Own Airtable base (e.g., UYSP = app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS)
- Own record in PostgreSQL `clients` table
- Own users, leads, campaigns (filtered by client_id)
- Own n8n workflows (dynamic base routing)

**Benefits:**
- Zero data leakage risk
- GDPR compliant (delete base = delete all data)
- Custom fields per client
- Independent campaigns
- Charge per client

## 🎯 TWO-WAY MESSAGING DETAILED SPEC

### What It Enables

**Current**: Send SMS → Track clicks/bookings  
**New**: Send SMS → Receive responses → AI analyzes → Auto-respond OR escalate to human

### How It Works

**Inbound Message Flow:**
```
1. Lead replies to SMS
2. SimpleTexting webhook → n8n
3. n8n looks up lead in Airtable
4. Reads full conversation_thread (JSON array with history)
5. AI analyzes:
   - Sentiment: positive/neutral/negative
   - Intent: interested/question/objection/unclear
6. Decision:
   - Simple/positive → AI generates contextual response, sends SMS
   - Complex/negative → Escalate to Human Review Queue
7. Updates Airtable:
   - Appends to conversation_thread (preserves full history)
   - Sets has_responded = TRUE
   - Updates sentiment, status, counters
8. Also hits portal API for instant PostgreSQL update (no 5-min wait)
9. Portal shows response in <1 second
```

**AI Agent Memory:**
- Reads entire `conversation_thread` from Airtable
- Has full context (even 3+ months old conversations)
- Generates natural, contextual responses
- Example: "Hi John, following up on our July conversation about AI BDR. You mentioned wanting to revisit in Q4..."

**Human Review Queue:**
- New page: `/leads/review-queue`
- Shows all escalated leads
- Beautiful chat UI (like iMessage)
- Sales team can reply directly
- Mark resolved or keep AI paused

**Airtable Storage:**
```json
conversation_thread: [
  {"from":"system","message":"Sent Step 1","timestamp":"2025-07-15T10:00:00Z"},
  {"from":"ai","message":"Hi John...","timestamp":"2025-07-15T10:01:00Z"},
  {"from":"lead","message":"Interested!","timestamp":"2025-07-18T14:30:00Z"},
  {"from":"ai","message":"Great! Calendar link...","timestamp":"2025-07-18T14:32:00Z"},
  {"from":"lead","message":"Text me in 3 months","timestamp":"2025-07-18T14:35:00Z"},
  {"from":"system","message":"Paused until Oct 18","timestamp":"2025-07-18T14:36:00Z"},
  {"from":"ai","message":"Hi John, following up...","timestamp":"2025-10-18T10:00:00Z"}
]
```

Full history in one field. AI reads all. Perfect context.

## 💰 COST STRUCTURE (Corrected with Shared Services)

### Shared Services (One Subscription for All Clients)
- Clay: $350/month (unlimited tier, all clients)
- n8n: $20/month (cloud) or $0 (self-hosted)
- OpenAI API: $50-200/month (total usage across all clients)
- Render Web Service: $25/month (one app, all clients)
- Render PostgreSQL: $25/month (one database, all clients)

**Total Shared**: $470/month (fixed regardless of client count)

### Per-Client Costs
- Airtable Base: $20/month (they need separate base for data isolation)
- SimpleTexting SMS: $50-100/month (depends on their volume)

**Total Per-Client**: $70-120/month

### Economics at Scale

**1 Client (current):**
- Shared: $470
- Per-client: $95
- **Total: $565/month**
- Charge: $1,500/month
- **Profit: $935 (2.6x margin)**

**10 Clients:**
- Shared: $470 (same!)
- Per-client: $95 × 10 = $950
- **Total: $1,420/month**
- **Per-client cost: $142**
- Charge: $1,500/month per client = $15,000 total
- **Profit: $13,580 (10.6x margin!)**

**50 Clients:**
- Shared: $470
- Per-client: $95 × 50 = $4,750
- **Total: $5,220/month**
- **Per-client cost: $104**
- Charge: $1,500/month per client = $75,000 total
- **Profit: $69,780 (14.4x margin!)**

**The more clients, the better the margins!**

## 🚨 KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. Airtable Strategy: Separate Bases Per Client ✅
**Decision**: Each client gets their own Airtable base  
**Why**: Security (data isolation), compliance (GDPR), customization (per-client schemas)  
**Trade-off**: More bases to manage, but automation handles it

### 2. Enrichment: Keep Clay ✅
**Decision**: Continue with Clay for now  
**Why**: Reliable, handles personal emails well, worth the cost  
**Future**: Build n8n waterfall in 6-12 months (when volume justifies)

### 3. Conversation Storage: JSON in Airtable ✅
**Decision**: Store full conversation in Long Text field (JSON array)  
**Why**: Simple, AI has full context, portal displays beautifully  
**Alternative rejected**: Separate conversations database (unnecessary)

### 4. Database: Hybrid (PostgreSQL + Airtable) ✅
**Decision**: Keep hybrid architecture  
**Why**: Best of both worlds (fast reads + automation flexibility)  
**Alternative rejected**: Full PostgreSQL migration (80-120h effort, high risk)
