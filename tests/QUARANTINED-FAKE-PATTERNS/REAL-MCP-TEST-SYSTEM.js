 * 🚨 QUARANTINED: FAKE TESTING PATTERNS DETECTED
 * 
 * This file has been quarantined due to fake testing patterns:
 * 
 * ❌ simulatedMCP: Simulated MCP calls instead of real ones (CRITICAL)
 * ❌ commentedMCP: Commented out real MCP calls (HIGH)
 * ❌ fakeResponseGeneration: Fake response generation (CRITICAL)
 * ❌ forDemonstration: Demonstration/simulation acknowledgment (HIGH)
 * ❌ wouldBeMade: Acknowledges fake calls with future tense (HIGH)
 * 
 * Original file moved to: tests/QUARANTINED-FAKE-PATTERNS/REAL-MCP-TEST-SYSTEM.js
 * 
 * DO NOT USE QUARANTINED FILES - THEY CONTAIN FAKE PATTERNS
 * Use REAL-MCP-TESTING-FRAMEWORK.js or mcp-automated-testing-system-FIXED.js instead
