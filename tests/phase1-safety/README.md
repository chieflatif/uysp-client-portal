# Phase 1 - Day 1 Complete

**Status**: ✅ All Airtable infrastructure done  
**Next**: Day 2 - Build safety workflows

---

## 📁 ESSENTIAL FILES ONLY

### 1. Field Reference (For n8n)
- `field-ids-correct-base.json` - All field IDs

### 2. Specifications (For Day 2)
- `ERROR-HANDLING-SPEC-COMPLETE.md` - n8n error patterns
- `TWILIO-CLICK-TRACKING-SPEC.md` - Click tracking integration
- `COMPLETE-ERROR-AND-TRACKING-SPEC.md` - Master spec

### 3. Implementation Summary
- `FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-CORRECTED.md` - What was built

**That's it. 5 files. Everything else was bloat.**

---

## ⚠️ DOCUMENTATION RULE (PREVENT BLOAT)

**CREATE DOCUMENTATION ONLY IF**:
1. ✅ It will be referenced in next session
2. ✅ It contains info not elsewhere
3. ✅ It serves a specific build task

**DON'T CREATE**:
- ❌ Multiple summaries of same info
- ❌ Checkpoint histories (git does this)
- ❌ Organization reports (waste)
- ❌ Status trackers (use ACTIVE-CONTEXT)
- ❌ Multiple indices (one README is enough)

**MAX FILES PER PHASE**: 5-7 files, not 30+

## 🎯 WHAT'S NEXT

Read: `/ACTIVE-CONTEXT-AI-MESSAGING.md`  
Then: Build Day 2 workflows per deployment guide

**Don't create more docs. Just build.**

---

*Rule: If it's not going to be used in next 2 sessions, don't create it.*
