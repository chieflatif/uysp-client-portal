# ARCHIVED: Wrong Base Implementation

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Reason**: These documents were created for the WRONG Airtable base  
**Status**: ARCHIVED - Do Not Use for Implementation

---

## ⚠️ WHAT HAPPENED

**Wrong Base**: appuBf0fTe8tp8ZaF ("UYSP Lead Qualification")  
**Correct Base**: app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS ("FINAL - UYSP Lead Qualification Table")

**Mistake**: Initial audit and planning done on wrong base  
**Caught By**: User opened Airtable and fields weren't there  
**Fixed**: Re-audited correct base, implemented correctly

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Always verify base ID with user before schema changes**
2. **Show Airtable URL and get confirmation**
3. **Check for existing systems (Oct 17 conversation system existed)**
4. **User's active URL is source of truth, not base names**

**Keep these files for**: Audit trail, learning purposes  
**Don't use for**: Any implementation or reference work
