# Testing Archive (2025-01-27)

This directory contains items archived during the consolidation of the testing infrastructure.

## Structure
- deprecated/: superseded specs (e.g., reality-based-tests-v2.json)
- redundant-scripts/: older shell runners from tests/scripts/ kept for reference
- empty-scaffolding/: empty or unused structures (tests/tests/*)

## Rationale
- Preserve history and reference while moving to a clean, maintainable structure.
- Avoid breaking existing docs by keeping older assets accessible.
