### Data Flow

**Lead Lifecycle:**
```
1. Lead Upload (CSV) → Portal validates → PostgreSQL (staging)
2. Portal → n8n webhook (bulk leads)
3. n8n → Clay enrichment API
4. Clay → n8n (enriched data)
5. n8n → Airtable (write enriched lead)
6. n8n → Portal webhook (enrichment complete)
7. Background sync: Airtable → PostgreSQL (5 min)
8. User sees enriched lead in portal
```

**Campaign Automation:**
```
1. Admin assigns lead to campaign → Updates Airtable
2. n8n monitors Airtable "Processing Status" field
3. When status = "Ready for SMS" → n8n triggers sequence
4. n8n → SimpleTexting API (send SMS)
5. Updates Airtable: SMS sent, sequence position++
6. Sync → PostgreSQL shows updated status
7. Portal displays campaign progress
```

**Two-Way Messaging:**
```
1. Lead replies to SMS → SimpleTexting webhook → n8n
2. n8n looks up lead in Airtable by phone
3. Appends to conversation_thread (JSON)
4. AI reads full conversation → generates contextual response
5. n8n → SimpleTexting (send AI response)
6. n8n → Airtable (update conversation)
7. n8n → Portal API (instant update to PostgreSQL)
8. User sees response in portal <1 second
```

## 🎯 HOW IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER

### Scenario 1: New Lead Upload

**User Story:** ADMIN uploads 500 leads from a webinar

```
1. ADMIN logs into portal (uysp-portal-v2.onrender.com)
2. Navigates to /leads/upload
3. Uploads CSV (500 rows)
4. Maps columns:
   - "Full Name" → First Name + Last Name
   - "Email Address" → Email
   - "Company Name" → Company
   - "Form ID" → unbounce-ai-webinar
5. Confirms upload

System Processing:
6. Portal validates data (emails valid, no duplicates)
7. Inserts to PostgreSQL with client_id + status="Pending Enrichment"
8. Triggers n8n webhook with leads array
9. n8n sends each lead to Clay for enrichment
10. Clay returns: LinkedIn URL, verified job title, company info
11. n8n writes enriched data to client's Airtable base
12. System checks form ID → auto-assigns campaign="AI Webinar - AI BDR"
13. Sets status="Ready for SMS"
14. n8n SMS workflow picks up lead, starts sequence
15. Background sync (5 min) pulls enriched data to PostgreSQL
16. ADMIN sees leads in portal with "Ready for Campaign" status

Time: 5-15 minutes from upload to first SMS sent
```

### Scenario 2: Lead Responds to SMS

**User Story:** Lead replies "Interested! Send me info"

```
1. Lead sends SMS to campaign number
2. SimpleTexting webhook → n8n
3. n8n looks up lead by phone in Airtable
4. Reads conversation_thread field (full history)
5. AI reads conversation:
   - "3 days ago: Sent intro message"
   - "2 days ago: Sent follow-up with case study"
   - "Just now: Lead replied 'Interested! Send me info'"
6. AI generates contextual response:
   - "Great! Here's our calendar link to schedule a demo: [link]"
   - References previous messages naturally
7. n8n appends to conversation_thread in Airtable
8. n8n sends AI response via SimpleTexting
9. n8n sets has_responded=TRUE, response_count++
10. n8n hits portal API /api/leads/[id]/conversation (instant PostgreSQL update)
11. Portal shows new response immediately (<1 second)
12. Sales rep sees notification: "New response from John Doe"
13. Clicks lead → sees full conversation in beautiful chat UI
14. Can reply manually or let AI continue

Time: <2 seconds from inbound SMS to portal visibility
```

### Scenario 3: Sales Rep Manages Leads

**User Story:** CLIENT user claims and qualifies leads

```
1. CLIENT user logs in
2. Dashboard shows:
   - 45 unclaimed leads (high ICP)
   - 12 new responses today
   - 3 booked meetings this week
3. User clicks "High ICP Leads" filter
4. Sees list of 45 leads, sorted by ICP score
5. Clicks "Claim" on lead #1 (John Doe, ICP: 85)
6. Lead detail page opens:
   - Contact info
   - ICP score: 85 (High)
   - Engagement score: 72 (High)
   - Campaign: AI Webinar - AI BDR
   - Sequence: Step 2 of 3
   - Last SMS sent: 2 days ago
   - Status: Clicked link (yes), Booked (no)
   - Conversation: 3 messages exchanged
7. User reads conversation, sees lead is interested
8. Adds note: "Follow up tomorrow with pricing details"
9. Updates status: "Qualified - Ready for Call"
10. Lead removed from sequence (automated)
11. User moves to next lead

All actions logged, visible to ADMIN in real-time
```
