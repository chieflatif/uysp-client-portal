# Deployment Setup Required

**Status**: Code implementation complete, database setup needed  
**Date**: 2025-10-20

## ✅ Code Implementation Complete

All code for hybrid architecture is implemented and ready:
- ✅ API endpoints for Airtable writes
- ✅ Analytics and reporting APIs
- ✅ Dashboard UI components
- ✅ Campaign drill-down pages
- ✅ Remove from campaign functionality
- ✅ Notes system (Airtable-backed)

---

## ⏳ Database Setup Required

### Issue Detected:
```
PostgresError: database "latifhorst" does not exist
```

### What This Means:
The DATABASE_URL in `.env.local` points to a database that hasn't been created yet, or the connection string is incorrect.

### To Fix:

#### Option A: Create Database
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql postgres

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE uysp_portal;

# Grant permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE uysp_portal TO your_user;

# Exit
\q
```

#### Option B: Update DATABASE_URL
Check `.env.local` and verify DATABASE_URL points to correct database:
```bash
# Should look like:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/uysp_portal"
```

#### Option C: Use Render/Supabase Hosted Database
If using Render or Supabase:
1. Create PostgreSQL instance
2. Copy connection URL
3. Update `.env.local` with new DATABASE_URL
4. Re-run migration

---

## 📋 Once Database is Ready

### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
cd uysp-client-portal
npm run db:push
```

This will create all tables with the new analytics fields.

### Step 2: Run Initial Sync
```bash
npm run sync:airtable
```

This will populate PostgreSQL with data from Airtable (11,046 leads).

### Step 3: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Access at: http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Once database is set up and sync complete:

### Test Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to `/analytics`
- [ ] Verify dashboard stats load
- [ ] Check campaign performance table
- [ ] Click "View Details" on campaign
- [ ] Verify sequence breakdown displays

### Test Remove from Campaign
- [ ] Open lead detail page
- [ ] Click "Remove from Campaign"
- [ ] Enter reason
- [ ] Confirm removal
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Check Airtable for status updates

### Test Notes System
- [ ] Add note to lead
- [ ] Verify note appears
- [ ] Check Airtable Notes field updated

---

## 🔧 Alternative: Skip Migration, Test APIs Directly

If you want to test without database setup:

### Test Airtable Write Operations:
```bash
# Test notes API (writes to Airtable)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/leads/LEAD_ID/notes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Test note", "type": "General"}'

# Test remove from campaign
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/leads/LEAD_ID/remove-from-campaign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Test removal"}'
```

These will work even without PostgreSQL if you have valid Airtable credentials.
