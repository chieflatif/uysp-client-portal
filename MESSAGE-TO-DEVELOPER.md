## üîç VERIFICATION NEEDED: Historical Call Records

### Overview
There are **three call records** in Airtable that should appear in the call history modal. These sync automatically from Airtable when you click the **Sync** button or view call history.

### Call Record #1 - October 15, 2025
- **Airtable Base**: `app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS`
- **Table**: `Project_Call_Summaries` (table ID: `tblvpmq10bFkgDnHa`)
- **Record ID**: `recAhkjKTmWlJBcqw`
- **Direct Link**: https://airtable.com/app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS/tblvpmq10bFkgDnHa/recAhkjKTmWlJBcqw
- **Call Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Status**: Historical call (should have `Is Latest = FALSE`)

### Call Record #2 - October 22, 2025
- **Record ID**: `recLsect851OEsZ5S`
- **Status**: This was the "Latest" call, but may now be historical
- **Note**: If there's a newer call, this should have `Is Latest = FALSE`

### Call Record #3 - Most Recent
- **Record ID**: `recyswJpePUnKpsDE`
- **Direct Link**: https://airtable.com/app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS/tblvpmq10bFkgDnHa/recyswJpePUnKpsDE
- **Status**: This should be the current latest call
- **Expected**: `Is Latest = TRUE` (this displays in the gradient card on PM page)

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Verify All Three Calls in Airtable
For each record, confirm these fields are populated:
- ‚úÖ `Call Date` - Should have a valid date
- ‚úÖ `Executive Summary` - Should have content
- ‚úÖ `Top Priorities` - Should have content
- ‚úÖ `Key Decisions` - Should have content (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ `Blockers Discussed` - Should have content (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ `Next Steps` - Should have content (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ `Attendees` - Should list who was on the call
- ‚úÖ `Call Recording URL` - Should have a link (if available)
- ‚úÖ `Is Latest` - **ONLY ONE** record should have this set to TRUE (the most recent)

**Important**: Ensure `Is Latest = TRUE` is set ONLY on record `recyswJpePUnKpsDE` (the newest call). All others should be `FALSE`.

### 2. Test Automatic Sync
The call history syncs automatically from Airtable. No manual database updates needed!

**To sync:**
1. Navigate to **Project Management** page
2. Click the **"Sync"** button in the header
3. Wait for "Sync completed successfully!" alert
4. The latest call card should update with the newest call
5. Click **"üìã View Call History ‚Üí"** to see all three calls

### 3. Verify Call History Display
1. Modal should open showing **ALL THREE calls** sorted by date (newest first)
2. The most recent call (top of list) should have:
   - Indigo/purple gradient background
   - Cyan "LATEST" badge
3. The two older calls should have:
   - Gray background
   - No "LATEST" badge
   - Same formatting as the latest call
4. Click call recording links to ensure they work
5. Test scrolling (if needed)
6. Close modal and reopen to verify consistency

### 4. Check API Response (If Calls Not Showing)

**Test the API directly:**
```bash
# Replace {clientId} with actual UYSP client ID
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/clients/{clientId}/call-history \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

**Expected response should include:**
```json
{
  "callHistory": [
    {
      "id": "recAhkjKTmWlJBcqw",
      "callDate": "2025-10-15",
      "executiveSummary": "...",
      "topPriorities": "...",
      "keyDecisions": "...",
      "blockersDiscussed": "...",
      "nextSteps": "...",
      "attendees": "...",
      "callRecordingUrl": "...",
      "isLatest": false
    },
    // ... other calls
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: October 15 call not appearing in modal

**Possible causes:**

1. **Record doesn't exist or is in wrong table**
   - Solution: Verify the Airtable link opens correctly
   - Check you're looking at base `app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS`

2. **Call Date field is empty or incorrectly formatted**
   - Solution: In Airtable, ensure "Call Date" is a Date field type
   - Set value to October 15, 2025

3. **API not fetching all records**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoint: `/src/app/api/clients/[id]/call-history/route.ts` (line 59-60)
   - Ensure sort parameter is correct: `sort[0][field]=Call Date&sort[0][direction]=desc`

4. **Client Base ID mismatch**
   - Verify UYSP client record in database has `airtableBaseId = app4wIsBfpJTg7pWS`
   - Check with: `SELECT airtableBaseId FROM clients WHERE name = 'UYSP';`

5. **Airtable API permissions**
   - Verify `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set
   - Check API key has read access to the base
