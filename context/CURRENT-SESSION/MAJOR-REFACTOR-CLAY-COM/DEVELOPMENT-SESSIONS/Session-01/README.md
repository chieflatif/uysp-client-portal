# Session-01: Clay Enrichment + Single SMS (Phase 1)

## Overview (Non-Technical)
- Enrich leads with Clay to qualify by ICP.
- Send one SMS per qualified lead during business hours.
- Track clicks via our redirect link; track deliveries/unsubs via SimpleTexting; meetings via Calendly.
- Throughput: 500/day, 5 hourly runs of 100 starting 10am ET.

## Objectives
- Build enrichment workflow and gating.
- Implement tracked single SMS sender.
- Add delivery/unsubscribe webhooks and click redirect.

## How this fits
