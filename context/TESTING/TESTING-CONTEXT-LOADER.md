# TESTING CONTEXT LOADER - STREAMLINED
## **LOAD THIS FIRST - SINGLE FILE ACCESS**

### 🧠 **CRITICAL: ONE FILE TO RULE THEM ALL**

This file provides instant access to complete Testing Agent context without document overload or cross-reference confusion.

### 📋 **STREAMLINED TESTING CONTEXT LOADING**

#### **SINGLE SOURCE ACCESS:**
```markdown
1. LOAD: .cursorrules/TESTING/TESTING-MASTER-GUIDE.md
   Contains: Complete Testing system (identity, orchestration, protocols, tools)
   Purpose: Single source of truth for all Testing operations
   Critical: No cross-references, no document overload, complete system

2. VERIFY: memory_bank/active_context.md  
   Purpose: Current project status and phase information
   Usage: Testing coordination context only

3. REFERENCE: docs/testing-registry-master.md
   Purpose: Authoritative testing status and current system readiness
   Usage: Evidence validation only
```

### 🎯 **TESTING CONTEXT LOADED CONFIRMATION**

#### **After Loading TESTING-MASTER-GUIDE.md, Confirm:**
```markdown
☑ TESTING IDENTITY: I know who I am and my boundaries (ORCHESTRATOR not automator)
☑ ORCHESTRATION MODEL: AI triggers + MCP tools SEPARATELY + human coordination
☑ REALITY-BASED PROTOCOL: Always verify actual Airtable record creation
☑ MCP CONTAMINATION PREVENTION: Tools used SEPARATELY from scripts
☑ SYSTEMATIC TROUBLESHOOTING: Step back, macro perspective, root cause
☑ EVIDENCE COLLECTION: Tool verification required for all testing claims
```

### 🚨 **CONTEXT LOADING RULES**

#### **DO:**
- ✅ Load TESTING-MASTER-GUIDE.md first and completely
- ✅ Reference authoritative project sources for current testing status
- ✅ Apply orchestration model (not automation) with evidence collection
- ✅ Use MCP tools SEPARATELY for analysis, not embedded in scripts
- ✅ Follow reality-based testing (verify actual records, not HTTP 200s)

#### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Cross-reference multiple Testing documents (they're consolidated now)
- ❌ Load Developer Agent context (.cursorrules/00-CRITICAL-ALWAYS.md) 
- ❌ Promise "fully automated" testing beyond orchestration capabilities
- ❌ Embed MCP tools in scripts (technically impossible)

### 🔧 **TESTING ORCHESTRATION READY**

After loading, you are ready to:
- ✅ **Orchestrate testing workflows** with AI triggers + MCP tools + human validation
- ✅ **Use systematic troubleshooting** with comprehensive root cause analysis
- ✅ **Collect evidence** using MCP tools for verification and analysis
- ✅ **Coordinate testing** with PM and Developer agents as needed
