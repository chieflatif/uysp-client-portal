### System message for next AI Developer Agent

- Role: Developer Agent (code only; no PM/testing). Use MCP tools; skip backups this session.

- Repo/branch
  - Current branch: `major-refactor-clay-com` (tracking `origin/major-refactor-clay-com`)
  - Remote: `https://github.com/chieflatif/UYSP-Lead-Qualification-V1.git`
  - Backups and commits were pushed already; do not run backup scripts now

- n8n workspace and assets
  - Project/workspace ID: `H4VRaaZhd8VKQANf`
  - Core workflows to work with:
    - `UYSP-Realtime-Ingestion` (ID `2cdgp1qr9tXlONVL`) – Active: Webhook → Normalize → Airtable upsert
    - `UYSP Backlog Ingestion` (ID `qMXmmw4NUCh1qu8r`) – Manual: CSV fetch/parse → Normalize → Airtable upsert
    - `UYSP-SMS-Trigger` (ID `D10qtcjjf2Vmmp5j`) – SMS path working via SimpleTexting; Airtable Trigger node exists but is disabled
    - `UYSP-Health-Monitor` (ID `wNvsJojWTr0U2ypz`) – Cron + Slack alert/daily report configured
  - SMS: SimpleTexting path tested and working; Slack channel `C097CHUHNTG` used for notifications

- Airtable details
  - Base ID: `app6cU9HecxLpgT0P`
  - Leads table ID: `tblYUvhGADerbD8EO`
  - View to watch for SMS Trigger: `SMS Pipeline`
  - Trigger field intended: `Last Updated Auto`

- Start-of-session checks (tools recheck)
  - Verify MCP connectivity:
    - List n8n workflows; confirm project scope to `H4VRaaZhd8VKQANf`
    - List Airtable bases and describe Leads table (confirm view/fields)
    - Optionally load n8n node docs via Context7, if you’ll modify node params
  - Do not run any backup scripts; they’ve already been completed

- Primary next tasks (development)
  - Productionize `UYSP-SMS-Trigger`:
    - Configure the existing Airtable Trigger node with Base=`app6cU9HecxLpgT0P`, Table=`tblYUvhGADerbD8EO`, Trigger Field=`Last Updated Auto`, View=`SMS Pipeline`
    - Enable the Airtable Trigger node
    - Keep existing SMS HTTP + Slack notify path intact
    - Optional: disable the Manual Test path to avoid confusion
  - Use ≤5 MCP operations per chunk (prefer `updateNode` and `enableNode`; simple `addConnection/removeConnection` if needed)
  - Evidence to capture in notes for each chunk:
    - n8n update response shows success + new `versionId`
    - Workflow structure reflects enabled trigger
    - Airtable schema/view confirmed
    - If you test, capture execution IDs

- Guardrails and gotchas
  - Do not reference conditional nodes from Airtable expressions
  - Ensure “Always Output Data” is OFF on routing IF nodes (Settings tab)
  - Preserve battle‑tested nodes: Smart Field Mapper v4.x, ICP Response Processor, Lead Qualifier V3.2
  - Stop after 2–3 failed connection attempts and request human UI wiring

- What to skip
  - Skip backup/export this session
  - Do not create new export scripts or manual JSON backups
  - Do not alter business logic thresholds without explicit instruction

- Ready-to-use IDs/strings
  - Project: `H4VRaaZhd8VKQANf`
  - Airtable Base: `app6cU9HecxLpgT0P`
  - Leads Table: `tblYUvhGADerbD8EO`
  - Workflows: `2cdgp1qr9tXlONVL`, `qMXmmw4NUCh1qu8r`, `D10qtcjjf2Vmmp5j`, `wNvsJojWTr0U2ypz`

Summary
- Backups/commits are done and pushed; branch set to `major-refactor-clay-com`.
- Recheck MCP access, then implement and enable the Airtable Trigger in `UYSP-SMS-Trigger` using the IDs above.
- Keep changes chunked (≤5 ops), collect evidence, and preserve existing working logic.
