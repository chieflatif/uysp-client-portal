# Session 1: Document Attachment Guide
*Optimal Context Engineering for Testing & Platform Gotcha Resolution*

## 🎯 **MANDATORY ATTACHMENT STRATEGY** [[memory:4136715]]

Based on our context engineering upgrade and Session 1 specific requirements, here are the **exact documents** you should attach to each Session 1 prompt:

### **CORE FOUNDATION** (Always Attach - 5 Documents)

1. **`.cursorrules/00-CRITICAL-ALWAYS.md`** ✅ 
   - **Why**: Contains context engineering upgrade protocols
   - **Key**: Anti-hallucination rules, evidence requirements, chunking protocols
   - **Usage**: Referenced for every tool call and success claim

2. **`docs/critical-platform-gotchas.md`** ✅
   - **Why**: Session 1 has critical platform gotcha resolution objectives
   - **Key**: Context engineering gotchas, boolean mapping, API automation
   - **Usage**: First reference before any n8n/Airtable operations

3. **`memory_bank/active_context.md`** ✅
   - **Why**: Current state tracking and critical priorities
   - **Key**: Smart Field Mapper regression, boolean conversion status
   - **Usage**: State verification before beginning any work

4. **`patterns/00-field-normalization-mandatory.txt`**
   - **Why**: Session 1 focuses on field mapping regression resolution
   - **Key**: Smart Field Mapper implementation, boolean conversion patterns
   - **Usage**: Reference implementation for regression fixes

5. **`docs/reference/uysp-critical-patterns & enforcement.md`** ✅
   - **Why**: Contains enforcement rules and proven patterns
   - **Key**: Evidence requirements, testing protocols, platform gotchas
   - **Usage**: Enforcement reference throughout session

### **SESSION 1 SPECIFIC** (Testing Focus - 3 Documents)

6. **`tests/comprehensive-test-plan.md`**
   - **Why**: Detailed test methodology for 55+ scenarios
   - **Key**: Category A-D test definitions, success criteria
   - **Usage**: Test execution planning and verification

7. **`tests/reality-based-tests-v3.json`** 
   - **Why**: Actual test payloads and verification protocols
   - **Key**: Field variation tests, boolean conversion tests, evidence requirements
   - **Usage**: Specific test cases and expected outcomes

8. **`context/session-1/session-1-context-package.md`** (NEW)
   - **Why**: Complete context package with learning integration
   - **Key**: Execution methodology, chunking strategy, evidence requirements
   - **Usage**: Session-specific guidance and success criteria

---

### **SUPPORTING REFERENCE** (Attach as Needed - 3 Documents)

9. **`patterns/01-core-patterns.txt`**
   - **When**: If working on workflow integration or API automation
   - **Why**: Contains n8n API automation patterns from context engineering upgrade

10. **`docs/reference/updated_development_sequence.md`**
    - **When**: If need to verify Session 1 objectives vs overall sequence
    - **Why**: Session 1 definition and prerequisites

11. **`memory_bank/task_management.md`**
    - **When**: If need to reference learning integration table
    - **Why**: Contains complete technical/non-technical learning integration status

## 📋 **OPTIMIZED ATTACHMENT COMBINATIONS**

### **Scenario 1: Starting Session 1** (8 Documents)
**Attach ALL Core Foundation + Session 1 Specific**
- Provides complete context for session objectives
- Includes all learning integration requirements
- Covers testing methodology and evidence protocols

### **Scenario 2: Mid-Session Testing** (6 Documents)
**Core Foundation + Test-Specific (6,7,8)**
- Focused on test execution and evidence collection
- Maintains context engineering compliance
- Streamlined for testing workflow

### **Scenario 3: Regression Debugging** (7 Documents) 
**Core Foundation + Field Normalization + Core Patterns (4,9)**
- Deep focus on Smart Field Mapper issues
- API automation patterns for debugging
- Complete troubleshooting context

### **Scenario 4: Evidence Collection** (5 Documents)
**Core Foundation Only (1-5)**
- Clean context for evidence compilation
- Focus on documentation and verification
- Prevents information overload during reporting

---

## 🔍 **CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION NOTES**

### **Why This Specific Combination?**

1. **Evidence-Based Selection**: Each document provides unique, non-redundant value
2. **Context Engineering Compliance**: All learning integration requirements covered
3. **Session-Specific Focus**: Testing and regression resolution priorities addressed
4. **Optimal Token Usage**: ~15K tokens total, well within context limits

### **What We're NOT Attaching** (Avoid Redundancy)

❌ **`docs/reference/uysp-implementation-guide.md`** - Too broad for Session 1 focus
❌ **`patterns/02-05-*.txt`** - Not relevant for testing/regression work  
❌ **`docs/reference/session-prep-guide.md`** - Already used for context creation
❌ **Multiple test files** - reality-based-tests-v3.json covers all needed payloads

### **Document Refresh Protocol**

**Before Each Session 1 Sub-Task:**
1. ✅ Always include Core Foundation (1-5)
2. ➕ Add Session 1 Specific (6-8) for new topics
3. 🔧 Add Supporting Reference (9-11) only when specifically needed
4. 📊 Remove when switching to pure evidence collection mode
