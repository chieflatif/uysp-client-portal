## 🎯 **CONTEXT ENGINEERING INTEGRATION**

### **Testing Agent Compliance Requirements**
1. **Evidence Collection**: All testing operations must generate quantitative evidence
2. **MCP Tool Usage**: Mandatory use of 54 MCP tools for all testing operations
3. **Success Criteria**: 95%+ field mapping, 100% boolean conversion targets
4. **Documentation**: Git-based evidence preservation and audit trails

### **Quality Gates**
