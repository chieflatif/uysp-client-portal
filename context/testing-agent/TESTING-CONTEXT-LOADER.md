# TESTING AGENT CONTEXT LOADER - SESSION 1-2 FOCUSED

## **LOAD THIS FIRST - SINGLE SOURCE CONTEXT**

This file provides complete Testing Agent context focused exclusively on Session 1-2 completion requirements.

---

## **📋 STREAMLINED TESTING CONTEXT LOADING**

### **CORE CONTEXT (Load These 3 Files)**

```markdown
1. LOAD: context/testing-agent/README.md
   Contains: Complete Testing Agent identity and Session 1-2 scope
   Purpose: Primary testing agent context with current architecture reality
   Critical: NO compliance testing, NO enterprise features, Session 1-2 ONLY

2. REFERENCE: docs/testing-registry-master.md  
   Purpose: Historical testing progression and current readiness status
   Usage: Verify Session 1-2 completion status and requirements
   Critical: ONLY reference for testing status claims

3. VALIDATE: tests/reality-based-tests-v3.json
   Purpose: Detailed test specifications and success criteria
   Usage: Understand what each test validates and expects
   Critical: Reality-based testing protocol with Airtable verification

4. TROUBLESHOOT: tests/SYSTEMATIC-TROUBLESHOOTING-FRAMEWORK.md
   Purpose: Comprehensive tool-based, evidence-driven troubleshooting methodology
   Usage: When ANY issue occurs - systematic root cause analysis protocols
   Critical: NEVER guess, NEVER play whack-a-mole, ALWAYS use MCP tools for evidence
```

### **TESTING TOOLS CONTEXT**

```markdown
4. TOOLS: tests/run-manual-tests.js
   Purpose: Primary JavaScript test runner (18 tests)
   Usage: Interactive testing with manual verification steps
   Critical: Requires n8n manual activation for each test

5. TOOLS: tests/session-0-real-data-validator.py
   Purpose: Automated Python test validator
   Usage: Comprehensive validation with real data processing
   Critical: Requires CSV file path correction

6. TOOLS: tests/quick-test-validation.js
   Purpose: Infrastructure validation (5 quick checks)
   Usage: Verify testing environment before full testing
   Critical: Run this first to validate setup
```

### **CURRENT ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT**

```markdown
7. ARCHITECTURE: config/workflow-ids.json
   Purpose: Current workflow IDs and component mapping
   Usage: Verify actual workflow configuration vs test expectations
   Critical: Main workflow wpg9K9s8wlfofv1u, NOT "PRE COMPLIANCE"

8. ARCHITECTURE: patterns/06-Reality-Based Testing Protocol.txt
   Purpose: Testing methodology and validation requirements
   Usage: Understand why we verify Airtable records, not just HTTP 200s
   Critical: Reality-based approach eliminates "testing theater"
```

## **🚫 DO NOT LOAD (Contaminated/Obsolete)**

### **COMPLIANCE CONTAMINATION (Ignore These)**
- ❌ `tests/COMPREHENSIVE-TESTING-ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS.md` - Contains compliance contamination
- ❌ `tests/pdl-readiness-test.js` - Tests obsolete "PRE COMPLIANCE" workflow
- ❌ `tests/comprehensive-mcp-validation.js` - Enterprise compliance feature detection
- ❌ `tests/workflow-comparison-test.js` - Compares non-existent workflows

### **CONTEXT7 MISUSE (Ignore These)**
- ❌ `tests/context7-*` files - Context7 is NOT for workflow validation
- ❌ `tests/CONTEXT7-*` documentation - Wrong tool for testing purposes

### **LEGACY DOCUMENTATION (Historical Only)**
- ❌ `tests/TESTING-GUIDE-UNIFIED.md` - Contains DND/compliance references
- ❌ `tests/TESTING-SUITE-STATUS.md` - Claims compliance testing capability
- ❌ `tests/comprehensive-test-plan.md` - Based on obsolete architecture

## **🎯 TESTING AGENT ACTIVATION SEQUENCE**

### **1. CONTEXT LOADING (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Load primary context files in this order:
1. context/testing-agent/README.md (Testing Agent identity)
2. docs/testing-registry-master.md (Historical status)
3. tests/reality-based-tests-v3.json (Test specifications)
```

### **2. ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION (1 minute)**
```bash
# Verify current system reality:
1. config/workflow-ids.json (Current workflow: wpg9K9s8wlfofv1u)
2. patterns/06-Reality-Based Testing Protocol.txt (Testing methodology)
```

### **3. TOOL PREPARATION (1 minute)**
```bash
# Validate testing infrastructure:
cd tests && node quick-test-validation.js
# Should show 5/5 tests passed for functional environment
```

### **4. TESTING EXECUTION (Variable)**
```bash
# Choose testing approach based on needs:
node run-manual-tests.js          # Interactive testing (18 tests)
python3 session-0-real-data-validator.py  # Automated validation
```

## **📊 SESSION 1-2 TESTING SCOPE VERIFICATION**

### **WHAT TO TEST (Session 1-2 Requirements)**
- ✅ **Field Normalization**: 18 field variation tests
- ✅ **Boolean Conversion**: String→Boolean for Airtable checkboxes
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Email-based upsert functionality
- ✅ **3-Field Phone Strategy**: phone_original + phone_recent + phone_validated
- ✅ **International Detection**: Country code recognition
- ✅ **Integration Validation**: Real Airtable record creation

### **WHAT NOT TO TEST (Future Sessions)**
- ❌ **NO Compliance Features**: DND, TCPA, 10DLC (handled by SMS service)
- ❌ **NO Enrichment Features**: Apollo API integration (Session 2+)
- ❌ **NO ICP Scoring**: Qualification logic (Session 3+)
- ❌ **NO SMS Campaigns**: Delivery functionality (Session 4+)

## **🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
1. **Test fails with curl error**: Check n8n workflow activation (manual step required)
2. **Python test can't find CSV**: File path issue with spaces in filename
3. **Airtable records not created**: Verify webhook URL and Smart Field Mapper deployment
4. **Boolean fields showing as strings**: Check Airtable field types and conversion logic

### **Evidence Collection Requirements**
- **Always Required**: Airtable record ID for successful tests
- **Always Verify**: Field mapping success rate calculation
- **Always Document**: Any execution errors with specific details
- **Always Check**: Manual verification matches expected results
