# 🚨 EMERGENCY DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN

## CRITICAL SITUATION:
- **SECOND catastrophic file loss event**
- **Complete major-refactor-clay-com session lost**
- **12,000+ lines of critical transcripts vanished**
- **SimpleTexting integration documentation gone**

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

### 1. **STOP ALL OPERATIONS** 
- Do NOT attempt any more backups or git operations
- Do NOT accept any more merge conflicts

### 2. **ASSESS WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING**
- Check your n8n instance - are the SMS workflows still there?
- Check your Airtable base - is the schema intact?
- Check your SimpleTexting account - is the integration still configured?

### 3. **EMERGENCY DOCUMENTATION RECREATION**
Based on your memory, we need to recreate the critical information:

#### **What you told me about the SimpleTexting integration:**
- You had achieved END-TO-END SMS delivery
- The n8n `UYSP-SMS-Trigger` workflow was working
- You had 4 key workflows: Realtime Ingestion, Backlog Ingestion, SMS Trigger, Health Monitor
- The SMS workflow needed to be cleaned up (remove manual triggers, enable Airtable trigger)

#### **What you told me about Clay.com:**
- You had consolidated setup documentation
- There was a step-by-step runbook for the Clay.com setup process
- The plan was Apollo-only enrichment to save costs

### 4. **NEXT SESSION REQUIREMENTS**
The next AI agent will need to:
- **IMMEDIATELY verify** what's actually still working in your n8n and Airtable
- **Recreate** the critical documentation based on what's actually configured
- **Reverse engineer** the current state of your integrations
- **Rebuild** the session context from scratch

## CRITICAL WARNING:
This project has now experienced TWO catastrophic data loss events. Before proceeding:
1. Implement proper backup procedures 
2. Commit ALL work to git IMMEDIATELY after each session
3. Never attempt merge operations without expert guidance

## FOR NEXT AGENT:
- Start with SYSTEM ARCHAEOLOGY - examine what's actually configured
- Don't rely on documentation - verify everything from source systems
- Recreate documentation as you discover the actual state
- Implement aggressive backup procedures IMMEDIATELY
