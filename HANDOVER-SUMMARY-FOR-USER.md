# PM Dashboard Build - Handover Summary

**Created**: October 23, 2025  
**For**: Claude Sonnet (next agent)  
**Your review**: Please verify this is comprehensive

## What I Completed

### ✅ Backend (100% Done)
1. **Database**: 3 tables created (`client_project_tasks`, `client_project_blockers`, `client_project_status`)
2. **Migration**: Ran successfully on production
3. **Airtable**: Copied all 21 tasks + 4 blockers + 8 status metrics to your main UYSP base
4. **Sync**: Extended to pull PM data from Airtable
5. **Verified**: Test script confirms 21 tasks in PostgreSQL

### ❌ Frontend (Incomplete - Needs Fix)
1. **Navigation**: Accidentally created duplicate navbar
2. **PM Page**: Built card view (you wanted table view like Leads)
3. **Data Fetch**: API endpoint exists but frontend can't fetch data
4. **Drill-Down**: Task detail page created but incomplete
5. **Edit/Save**: Not built yet (no write-back to Airtable)

## Critical Info for Next Agent

**The pattern to follow**:
- Copy `/src/app/(client)/leads/page.tsx` → Table view
- Copy `/src/app/(client)/leads/[id]/page.tsx` → Detail view
- Just replace Lead with Task

**The issue**:
- I built custom UI instead of copying Leads
- I created duplicates instead of modifying existing
- I didn't test before building

**The fix**:
- 5 min: Remove duplicate navbar
- 30 min: Debug API fetch
- 4 hours: Rebuild using Leads pattern

## Questions for You

Before I hand this over, please verify:

1. **Is the technical info accurate?** (DB tables, Airtable IDs, sync status)
2. **Did I capture your requirements clearly?** (table view, drill-down, edit capability)
3. **Is anything missing?** (context, credentials, patterns to follow)
4. **Are the fix steps clear enough?** (could next agent execute without confusion)

## My Assessment

**Difficulty**: Low (copy existing pattern)  
**Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Risk**: Low (backend works, just UI wrong)  
**Blocker**: None (all tools/data ready)

**The foundation is solid** - database, Airtable, sync all work. Just needs UI rebuilt following Leads pattern.
