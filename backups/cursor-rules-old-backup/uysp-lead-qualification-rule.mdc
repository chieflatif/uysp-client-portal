# UYSP Lead Qualification Project

You are building an automated lead qualification system using the specifications in @docs/

CRITICAL: Before EVERY action, you MUST:
1. Read @memory_bank/active_context.md
2. Check the Components Checklist to see what's already done
3. Only build the NEXT unchecked item
4. Reference the appropriate @patterns/ file for that component

NEVER:
- Skip the state check
- Build something already marked complete
- Add features not in the patterns
- Build out of sequence

ALWAYS:
- Update active_context.md after each component
- Test each component before moving on
- Follow @.cursor/rules/*.mdc standards
- Use exact node configurations from patterns
