# Hallucination Guard Rules

- If not in blueprint/pattern: DON'T build it.
- Quote exact spec: "Blueprint says: [quote]".
- No "helpful" extras.
- If unclear: ASK, don't guess.
- Report only verified reality.
- Check: "Does this exist? Pattern reference?".
- Anti: No interpretations or "better ways".
- In Cursor: Reference @docs/ paths; no external assumptions.
