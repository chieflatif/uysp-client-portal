## Known Limitations (For Next Phase)

These are coming in TIER 2:
- ❌ Can't add notes to leads yet
- ❌ Can't change lead status
- ❌ Can't assign to team members
- ❌ Can't export leads to CSV
- ❌ No activity feed yet
- ❌ No bulk actions

All of these have infrastructure in place - just need UI.

---

## Database

### Test Data Available
- Leads table has been synced from Airtable
- You can claim/unclaim any lead
- New users can be created
- All data persists in PostgreSQL

### Database Query (if needed)
```bash
# Connect to database
psql -U uysp_user -d uysp_portal

# View leads
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email, icp_score, status FROM leads LIMIT 10;

# View users
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, role FROM users;

# View claimed leads
SELECT * FROM leads WHERE claimed_by IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't connect to database
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
brew services list

# If not running, start it
brew services start postgresql@16

# If that fails, reinstall
brew reinstall postgresql@16
```

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill it (if needed)
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Issue: Dependencies missing
```bash
# Reinstall
npm install

# Clear cache if still failing
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Issue: Seeing old pages
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Rebuild
npm run build
npm run dev
```
