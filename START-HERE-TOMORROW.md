## üéØ QUESTIONS ANSWERED

**Q: Do we store conversations in separate database?**  
A: No. Store in Airtable `conversation_thread` field (JSON). PostgreSQL mirrors it.

**Q: How does AI remember 3-month-old conversations?**  
A: AI reads full `conversation_thread` JSON from Airtable. All history preserved in one field.

**Q: Should we migrate from Airtable to PostgreSQL?**  
A: No. Keep hybrid approach. Airtable = automation hub, PostgreSQL = portal performance.

**Q: Should we replace Clay with n8n waterfall?**  
A: Not yet. Keep Clay for now (reliable). Build n8n waterfall in 6 months when volume justifies it.

**Q: Can ADMIN create users?**  
A: Yes (as of latest deployment). ADMIN can create users for their own client. Auto-generates passwords.
