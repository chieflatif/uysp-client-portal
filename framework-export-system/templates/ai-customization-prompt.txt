## AI FRAMEWORK CUSTOMIZATION PROMPT TEMPLATE

**Use this prompt template when starting AI customization of the UYSP framework in your new project.**

---

### CUSTOMIZATION PROMPT:

```
I have imported the UYSP Development Framework into my new project and need you to analyze my project documents and intelligently customize the framework to match my specific requirements.

DOCUMENTS PROVIDED:
- Product Requirements Document: [attach your requirements document]
- Architecture Blueprint: [attach your technical architecture]
- Development Plan: [attach your project timeline/plan]
- Business Logic Specifications: [attach your workflow/process documents]

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Project Name: [Your Project Name]
- Industry/Domain: [e.g., E-commerce, CRM, Content Management]
- Primary Use Case: [Brief description of main functionality]
- Key Integrations: [List external systems to connect]
- Expected Volume: [Data volume expectations]

CUSTOMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
Please follow the AI-AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md file in the docs/ directory to:

1. ANALYZE my project documents and extract requirements using the provided framework
2. CUSTOMIZE the imported UYSP framework components for my specific needs:
   - Field normalization patterns for my data structure
   - Workflow templates for my business processes  
   - Database schema for my data entities
   - Testing scenarios for my use cases
   - Documentation specific to my project

3. VALIDATE that customizations meet my requirements and are technically feasible

4. PROVIDE a detailed customization report showing:
   - Requirements analysis summary
   - Specific framework adaptations made
   - Implementation recommendations
   - Testing and validation plan

FRAMEWORK PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST preserve field normalization as first workflow step
- MUST maintain anti-hallucination protocols and confidence scoring
- MUST keep 3-agent system separation (PM/Testing/Developer)
- MUST maintain MCP tool integration patterns
- MUST preserve platform gotcha prevention patterns

START BY: Reading docs/AI-AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md and then analyzing my provided documents to create a customization plan.

Use evidence-based analysis and include confidence scores for all recommendations.
```

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Fill in the project context** with your specific information
2. **Attach your project documents** (requirements, architecture, dev plan)
3. **Paste this prompt** to your AI agent in the new project
4. **Review the customization plan** before approving implementation
5. **Validate results** using the provided testing tools

### EXPECTED TIMELINE:
- Document Analysis: 30-60 minutes
- Framework Customization: 1-3 hours  
- Validation & Testing: 30-60 minutes
- **Total**: 2-5 hours for complete customized framework

### SUCCESS INDICATORS:
