## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (FINAL)

### Decision 1: Keep Airtable + PostgreSQL Hybrid ‚úÖ

**Rationale:**
- Airtable = automation hub (n8n, webhooks, Clay)
- PostgreSQL = portal performance (fast reads)
- Migration to PostgreSQL-only = 80-120 hours, high risk
- Current hybrid works well

**Action:** Enhance hybrid, don't migrate

### Decision 2: Keep Clay, Plan n8n Hybrid Later ‚úÖ

**Now (0-10k leads/month):**
- Use Clay for all enrichment
- Cost: $500-1k/month
- Reliable, worth the cost

**6 months (10k+ leads/month):**
- Build n8n waterfall for work emails
- Clay fallback for personal emails
- Save $300-500/month

**Action:** Defer n8n waterfall to Q2 2026

### Decision 3: Conversation Storage in Airtable JSON ‚úÖ

**Why:**
- Simple (one Long Text field)
- AI reads full history
- Portal displays beautifully
- No separate database needed

**Action:** Implement as planned
